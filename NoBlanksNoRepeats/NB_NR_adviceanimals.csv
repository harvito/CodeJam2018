more information about them    click here     http  wwwredditcomwikifaq  for reddit s frequently asked questions page    be sure to also read  the rediquette   https  wwwredditcomwikireddiquette  which is an informal guide to reddit etiquette   _____   rule 2  do nt be a jerk   we re here to have a laugh  hate speech  bigotry  and personal attacks are not allowed     death threats and telling others to kill themselves will result in a ban   this is pretty self explanatory  _____   rule 3  follow the correct format   two line joke over a reusable character   we understand that some established memes do not follow this format  such as   what year is it    http  knowyourmemecommemeswhatyearisit    i should buy a boat cat   http  knowyourmemecommemesishouldbuyaboatcat   etc however  these memes are already well established and thus have been grandfathered in    not all image macros are memes   gt  meme  gt  m  m gt  noun gt  an element of a culture or system of behavior that may be considered to be passed from one individual to another by nongenetic means  esp imitation  gt   source   http  wwwoxforddictionariescomusdefinitionamerican_englishmeme  basically if the image is only relevant to one s own submission and ca nt be reused  or has limited reusability  then it s just an image macro and by definition not a meme    this is an example of a generic image macro   https  iimgurcomlt1fi3njpg  and   this is an example of a meme   https  iimgurcom871gsb7jpg  memes are allowed on the subreddit here  while generic image macros are better suited for rfunny  _____   rule 4  do nt repost   do nt post stuff you found from elsewhere on the web  it s probably been here already   this subreddit is for original content only  meaning memes you made  do not resubmit your post because it did poorly  reposting is a bannable offense  if you see a repost please report it as such  and  send a quick note to the mods   http  wwwredditcommessagecompose  to   2fr

0dandhereisproofthatitisarepost   if you can  ____   rule 5  no cake day posts   cake day posts are not allowed   posts that mention cake day in the title  or in the post itself will be removed  ____   rule 6  verticals  puffins and batman slaps   please do not post verticals  opinion puffins or batman slaps   verticals are multiple panel memes or image macros and both are better suited for either rfunny or rvertical    this is an example of a vertical meme   http  iimgflipcombhnkijpg    this is an example of a vertical image macro   https  iimgurcomurhutjpg  this also means posts such as  911 lois   http  iimgurcomdxdsliojpg  are nt allowed  and memes such as  nobody cares nedry   http  iimgurcomp4kwk1ijpg  and  confused gandalf   http  iimgurcomtkujva3jpg  are limited to their 1 panel standard  instead of their alternate vertical counterparts  2 adviceanimals in a vertical are ok  meaning combining 2 established memes together such as  socially awkward penguin   http  knowyourmemecommemessociallyawkwardpenguin  and  socially awesome penguin   http  knowyourmemecommemessociallyawesomepenguin  is fine   here is an example of its acceptable use   https  iimgurcomsrygjdojpg    this is unpopular opinion puffin   http  iimgurcomqs4z4rmjpg    this is an example of a batman slap   https  iimgurcom5rrb52fjpg  _____   rule 7  link directly to your image

http  imgurcommemegen http  makeamemeorgnewest _____   rule 8  people you know   do nt make memes with pics of people that you saw in real life ever   do nt try to make yourself or someone you know into a meme  also  we do not allow witch hunts on the subreddit  _____   rule 9  use an approved host   shortened links  facebook  tumblr  blogspot  etc  will be automatically removed   please use one of the approved websites listed on the sidebar to make your post  _____   rule 10  mods have the final say   we reserve the right to remove posts  remove comments  and ban users at our own discretion   due to the nature of the subreddit  interpretations of what is a meme and what is an image macro sometimes have different opinions and thus decisions have to be made  _____   always feel free to

all of my previous gf s have demanded i text goodnight and good morning with an accompanying  i love you   i really hate this it s so robotic and inauthentic to just mechanically send text messages because of my state of wakefulness it devalues the phrase  i love you  and just feels so phony to me  i m a pretty fiercely independent person and need my own space texting literally all day or i face hell is such a huge drag for me i d rather send 34 texts a day that are real and emotive  and if we really have nothing funny  poignant  or substantive to text to one another all day it s really not the end of the world to just not text for a day just holding boring conversations over text all day brings down everything else about the relationship for me  plus  it s really nice to have something to catch up on when you see eachother again  when you re getting playbyplay updates of her day at work  her conversation with her mother  or her experience grocery shopping  then by the time you re together in person you ve exhausted possible conversation topics  tl  dr i m probably guilty of this ,d014fiv,adviceanimals,humor,1455572659,JetJaguar124,165,0,0,0,

the shitty reality  the majority of relationships i see are destructive based on need and insecurity rather than anything positive  and its not a young thing either a few years back an older family couple were given a big party for their 50 years of marriage and everyone was congratulating them  but the actual reality  he was an abusive drunk  and when he finally died  she got her life back but we crave this bullshit fairtytale  forever after   when we should be praising quality  not years are you good for each other  do you add to each others lives  are you just a homoenous blob  together so long that the idea of being alone puts so much fear into you that the idea has to be shut down  if so  get out and quickly go cold turkey for a year  face that wall and then start again but go for the positive pepople  the folk who show love daily  not in gesture bullshit like flowers or gifts  but their damn actions  day in  day out thats love  its the small things  but ultimately its about putting the other persons happiness first  and if you both do that  well you might stand a chance   anything else is a cancer which will eat your time and you wont get it back i grew up with some family friends  childhood sweethearts he was a cocky know it all type  but a nice guy when they hit their 40s she confessed she never loved him and left him for his best friend  who she had been having an affair with he changed  and within a few years he had a heart attack and is now a shadow of his former self  a recluse and lost his life pulled away from under him but again  every  aaaaewed  the chidlhood sweetheart line  subtly pressuring them to stay together  and she did and thats what we wanted  this security that childhood sweethear shit is real and we can get swept of our feet and live the happy ever after but its usually not like that  most of the time the euphoria felt is the inesecrity being temporaily filled by the validation of someone elses love and thats hard to let go of  as when things turn sour  you have to have that validation taken away  get it for yourself first  then take that into your future and see what happens  ,d01l82u,adviceanimals,humor,1455599649,Craig_Hedge,17,0,4734,1942,0

hi  i have worked in wildlife rehab and can likely shed some light on this topic for those who do nt know one of the most common problems rehab facilities face is the process of imprinting an animal onto humans  or a lesser version of that where the animal just thinks that all humans are providers of food imagine releasing an imprinted bear  the bear thinks that he belongs with humans and will go try to find other humans to hang out with or score food from this is how  nuisance animals  are made  and you better believe people will call anybody to get this big fucking bear off their property  around me it is usually the dnr and in most cases it is putting the bear down this is why you see rehabers wearing costumes or masks when working with wildlife to be released so that animal does nt know what the big thing with the food is here is an example of people working with cranes  https  media2wnycorgi1200627c80photologueimages4bop_mig_crane_costumejpg people are nt perfect and there is a cute affectionate fox to be taken care of  and it s easier than you might imagine to imprint an animal onto people  especially when said animal is very young what most likely happened is that the workers spent too much time trying to play or cuddle with the little guy ,d02m9lk,adviceanimals,humor,1455670436,Bringer_of_Bears,111,0,96,799,0
