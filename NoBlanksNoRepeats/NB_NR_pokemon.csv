what s the one pokemon  that when it shows up against you in battle  even aicontrolled  it annoys you the absolute most and why  for me  it s bronzong bronzong has a ridiculous amount of resistances paired with two abilities that can negate one of its weaknesses as well as having a decent amount of bulk  it can power down fire types with rain dance  up its own defense with iron defense  absolutely destroy with gyro ball  become a mobile tank with trick room  and  when ai controlled typically  makes my whole team fall asleep with its hypnosis  battlemaisonhax this guy s impossible to ohko for me  anyone else have a specific pokemon that really annoys them ,45yvzn,pokemon,gaming,1455572143,Hatrix_,14,0,1,111,0

 link to the pokemon center online shop   https  wwwpokemoncenteronlinecom  so now that the pokemon center online shop in japan has opened  i think that we all want to go bananas with our money so as someone who lives in japan and knows japanese  i would like give everyone some simple information about it  now first of all  the shop contains all of the current products that are available in the physical pokemon center shops  excluding shop exclusive items   but in return  the online pokemon center has some limited goods of its own    1 shipping   the shipping   japan only   cost 540   jpy  for orders that are under 5000   orders over 5000  are free  the boxes comes in  custom pokemon cardboard boxes   https  wwwpokemoncenteronlinecom  s  specialbox6290   it is also possible to choose gift wrapping if you pay an aditionall fee the shipping time is estimated to be 27 days    2 limited goods   there are several goods limited to the pokemon online center  including the extremely nice  kanto gym badge set   https  wwwpokemoncenteronlinecom  s  specialakamidori2154   there are also ongoing campains  where if you use more than 5000   you will get a random  1 out of 3 filefolder   https  wwwpokemoncenteronlinecomstaticimagespecialakamidori2154box02_bkpng   the next campaign  lasting from 19th of march  to 22nd of april  will have a similar system but instead of filesfolders  you will get a random  1 out of 3 mug cup   https  wwwpokemoncenteronlinecomstaticimagespecialpikachu2918paragraph03png  for those who shop at the online shop for the first time  will recieve a pikachu with fly and surf as moves the campaign will last until 22nd of may  and the serial code will be valid until 31st of august also  the code is only usable on japanese games  thanks umirukushake     3  point system   https  wwwpokemoncenteronlinecom  s  specialpokepoint8124    now the point system is where stuff gets interesting  1  of what you paid will become something called pokepoints  meaning that 10 000  would be 100 pokepoints   those points can later be used to play minigames if you would win in the minigames  you win special goods now it is unspecified about what kind of minigames and what kind of goods one are able to win for the time being so we just have to wait for more information    4 account and how to buy   if you want to buy something from the website  you have to make an account for the website this is the tricky part  because to be able to make an account  you have to have a japanese adress and phone number on top of that  as mentioned before  it only ships inside japan  so how do you buy  you ask  if you dont have japanese friends or family  your best go to option would be to use a website called  tenso   http  wwwtensocomen   so what happens is that you set your shipping adress to tenso in japan so that they get the items they will then send the products to your home  personally  i have never used tenso  seeing as i have no need for it but i ve heard good stuff about the service from a close friend that uses it alot to shop on the japanese amazon  other than that  if you just want to browse  i ve made a  small translation on the search engine found on the website   http  imgurcomewpjhvu   if there is something i forgot or something you were wondering about  please ask  and i will answer as fast as i can ,460kv1,pokemon,gaming,1455593917,AsianMixMaster,38,0,1737,1010,0

nidoqueen they had a really great thing going with the nidoran line having the opposite gender s colours for their shinies  and then they messed it all up by making nidoqueen mostly green and it s not even a nice green  and it clashes with the pink  also nidoran m and nidorino shuld have blue insides of their ears  not brown  for the same reason  it would be neat if shiny golduck was yellow  like shiny psyduck is blue you may be able to tell that i like swapped palettes  shiny rapidash is okay i guess  but i d rather they kept the blue mane that shiny ponyta has instead of changing it to grey  generally  most of the green ones  to be honest  unless the nonshiny version is green as well espeon comes to mind ,d00obu5,pokemon,gaming,1455548588,Holly164,34,0,1,5782,1

the problem is the 6 pokemon per team rule as soon they added legendaries this rule was retarded they are kinda forced to take the same pokemon to cover enough  i think they should increase it to 12 pokemon per box  and 6 pokemon in battle this would make the fights by far more intersting and less rng luck based the thing is currently get one counter death and you win the game groudon without a hard counter is unstopable same goes for xerneas and kyogre ,d012jt4,pokemon,gaming,1455569905,Bsss11,5,0,1,16,0

the original gen 1 box arts are still my favorites i m a huge fan of the older pokemon art style and use of water colors they were less round and cartoony mad more rugged and earthy  i do nt know if that s an accurate description but it s the best my limited vocabulary could come up with   i also like how they used starters for the covers it was kind of like showing off what your hard work and devotion will earn you without spoiling much i m sure most people like use of legendaries now but i feel like it kills some of the mystery and excitement when they plaster what is essentially your endgame right on the cover instead of getting your mind blown by discovering this badass mysterious pokemon  you re just expecting it from the get go granted  there are more than two legendaries in the games but why spoil any of it ,d01jv14,pokemon,gaming,1455597039,BakaDoug,6,0,389,1467,0

since i got my start when the game first released  i originally stopped playing when ruby and sapphire were announced at that point  i was approaching high school and various factors kicked in  i focused more on other games  video games  tcgs   pokemon had a stigma attached to it  i did nt have a gba  and was nt really looking to get one at the time   and  obviously  schoolrelated activities became more commonplace but  one of the big factors was that  after having played a sequel to the original games in gsc  i was disappointed to go somewhere new with no connections to the previous games and have very few returning pokemon  i wanted to pick the series back up when frlg came out  but i did nt have the funds to buy it or a gba i remember being intrigued by diamond and pearl  but  again  not excited enough to jump back into the fold once hgss were announced  and i was in college   i pounced back in as gsc had been my favorites for a long time by that point i did skip gen v on release because  as like with ruby and sapphire  the  reboot  aspect kinda rubbed me the wrong way  but the story in gen v is arguably the best in the main series  i again picked the series back up with xy riding the hype of 3d and the fact that a lot of people were diving back in to the series  but i found it lackluster  and it was nt for the fact that i had wanted to play through hoenn and did nt want to go back to the prephysicalspecial split era to do it  i might not have picked up oras the next game s announcement  features  etc are going to make or break whether i continue with the series again or not  i m just so burned out of doing the same things over and over and over again with the series and being  bored  while doing it if there was a fromthestartofthegame difficulty selection  as there  should  be   having to slog through the same overall plot outline each time might be more bearable to me ,d026z4s,pokemon,gaming,1455648864,Grefyrvos,0,0,0,0,

i thought about leaving pokemon after binging on pearl  messing around with some action replay codes along the way   and seeing blackwhite s new pokemon kinda drove the nail in the coffin  yes  i took a naive approach to them and called a few of them  outlandish  really ashamed of that now that i think about it   the bw anime arc also drove me to stop watching the new episodes  however  when i was browsing a gamestop one day about 3 years ago  i noticed there was a blackwhite 2 i went with my instinct and bought black 2  as i needed to fill the void left by leaving pokemon boy  was i blown away at how great black 2 is i even put in more hours on that game than my pearl save file ever since then i ve been following pokemon again through the end of gen 5 and currently into gen 6  and maybe even 7 if magearna is our first look into the next generation i really enjoy watching the xy arc more than playing the current gen games though  to be honest ,d028g57,pokemon,gaming,1455650855,ckbruin13,3,0,1,57,0

i ve been playing a lot of mystery dungeon lately  so it has to be aerodactyl  some context might be needed for this one in rescue team  there s a chain of missions in the postgame that ends by concluding a major plot point from before the credits one of these missions is to go through a dungeon called pitfall valley it s 25 floors long floors 2125 only have 1 pokemon spawning on them  aerodactyl aerodactyl has the pressure ability  forcing me to use up my moves twice as fast  when the game had been particularly unforgiving with max elixir distribution  and these particular ones carry supersonic and agility so these guys are essentially zubats on steroids and that s all there is for 5 floors  a distant second  due to the same game is gengar  but the reasons are rather spoilery so i wo nt say anything ,d029rum,pokemon,gaming,1455652620,Foowig,2,0,0,0,

do you think there is a regional pokedex which can be completed without help from a guide  starting with gen ii  in generation i  i think you could complete the pokedex without any walkthrough  various people in the game told you clues about evolutionary stones  evolution by trade  and the legenday pokemons where in places you were naturally led to explore the rarest pokemons were the safari ones i think  but with a little patience you could catch them the legit way  but starting with generation ii  some evolution methods were impossible to guess  held items while trading  happiness  albeit you could max this one without knowing about it  just by levelingup   so i think a walkthrough may be compulsory to complete the jotoh pokedex  generation iii is yet again a step in the cryptic direction  unless you re lucky  there s no getting a shedinja without outside help the 6tilesfeebas is yet another  walkthroughalmostcompulsory  moment  not mentioning his convoluted evolution method and finally  i do nt think there s any trainer in the game using a chimecho  making it impossible to locate with the pokedex perhaps the regiriddle can be solved by a determined player  ca nt say myself as i was using a guide back then  right now i m finally playing gen iv  and i ve advanced the sinnoh pokedex as much as i can all alone  because i love discovering things by myself  but i fear i might soon have to search for answers on internet  as i m having difficulties with quite a number of pokemons  so i was wondering  is it even possible to complete a regional pokedex without a kind of guide  trading is authorized for evolution and versionexclusive pokemons purposes only has any of you been stubborn enough to complete a regional pokedex by yourself  without external help  mythical pokemons are out of the equation  because they are not needed to get the diploma ,d02kivl,pokemon,gaming,1455667785,jopopoe,1,0,1,0,0

for me  it was always a money issue  growing up  i bought myself all the games red  blue  yellow  gold  silver  crystal  even ruby and sapphire i loved them to death but then i graduated high school  and went to college college was hard  and after struggling there for four years  i had no job to speak of times were hard  part of me always loved pokemon though always remembered the great times we had growing up after many  many long years of barely scraping by  i moved across the country a few times before settling into my current job it s a very boring job  with lots of dead time so i loaded up a gba emulator on my kindle  popped in emerald  because i had dreams of getting a mew finally   and something clicked again the world i had left changed drastically  and i knew i wanted back in  eventually i discovered a neat little game shop just down the street from my place i met the owner  and we ve become great friends and it s all because i did nt want to shut up about pokemon when he was chatting to one of the other customers about it  now  it s over two years later  i have a 3ds  two ds s  and a copy of every gen v game but w2  and all the gen vi games after nearly twenty damned years   i have my mew   and i am more excited over pokemon than i have ever been  but i think the real reason why i ve come back now is all thanks to oras i m so glad i picked as for my first gen vi title  because it s shown me what an absolutely exciting place that pokemon is right now  and what a wonderful place it s going to continue changing into ,d02kjxp,pokemon,gaming,1455667829,legend8804,2,0,1,649,0

evolving pokemon through friendship really makes me happy  when i first played pokemon way back in crystal  i caught a zubat as one of my first pokemon i got it up to golbat and thought that was it for my little friend but later in my adventure  it evolved into crobat i was both excited and confused  not knowing what i did it was nt until later that i learned that it evolves based on happiness it had such a profound impact on me as kid that i pretty much had a crobat in every game from then on  nowadays i ve seemed to have lost most of the heart i had as a kid but my crobat reminds me to enjoy the game and not get too technical ,d02scsr,pokemon,gaming,1455679919,Djinn04,2,0,1,762,0

i thought about it  and for me one of the most fun aspects of a pok  mon game is discovering the pokemons in the wild  which routes they are on  and how many are they in the region i completed my dex on y and or  and when you go through all the hard work you just want to never do it again  but when you get that fresh new game  if you transfer your complete dex  it just feels less rewarding you know where to find all poke mons and you do nt have the drive to  catch them all  because they are already registered  so  in my opinion  it is a bad idea to transfer the dex  also  it would nt make sense for the story  since each character is different from regions  the player is the same so how do you explain a professor asking you to fill out the national dex but saying  hey  we already have someone that completed it in another region  we really do nt need your services  goodbye  and your pokemon journey ends right there ,d02ske1,pokemon,gaming,1455680278,darkfrozzy,5,0,13,1669,0

it really is nt a feature i miss  but a gameplay aspect i m starting to notice  i miss how gym leaders could use a different number of pok  mon ever since black and white came out  the first two gym leaders use 2 pok  mon while the rest of them use 3 the other regions had some variety  in kanto for example  brock and misty use 2  lt surge uses 3 or 1 depending on the version  erika  sabrina  and blaine use 3  koga uses 4  and giovanni uses 5   elite four using 4 pok  mon is also something i do nt like i know oras is nt guilty of this but i think z will  i also miss the level variations the gym leaders  elite four  champion  and other bosses had i m sure many have noticed how the lead pok  mon is at the same level as every other pok  mon that the boss uses except for the ace  the lead pok  mon is always 2 levels less than the ace   it s just making the games a bit more predictable ,d02tp1u,pokemon,gaming,1455682211,Zero_Millennium,1,0,8,1909,0

reposting what utheunclebob put in the rnintendo thread  gt  i m just going to throw this out there  but tpc probably has some fairly highpaid lawyers anyone saying that tpc is in error or preo had the license to do this i d put  5 down that you re wrong i feel that  in some way  preo violated the exact terms of the license and thus  tpc put the hammer down it s possible they re mistaken  but that s a pretty huge mistake  gt  now  assuming we re hearing the whole story  they re being a     about it if tpc ca nt be contacted by preo  or  better yet  contact him before the legal action  to determine what the issues was and how to fix it  well  that s just s      of them  gt  as for youtube  they are not at fault if preo is in violation of his license agreement and tpc has logded a complaint  nothing youtube can do except comply it s the law and all  contrary to the gut reaction  tpci has done nothing but support the community with their actions lately  especially on the tcg side of things   and comes across as a much more progressive company to fan response than nintendo  this is really odd  and i have a feeling something behind the scenes is going on ,d02u5y7,pokemon,gaming,1455683038,ThePokemonMaster123,4,0,253,7489,0
