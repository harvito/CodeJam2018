does anyone know if conservatives  particularly republicans in the south  have some kind of more subtle agenda  s  beneath the veneer of  prolife  and  limited government   attempts to impede women s access to care in 2016 is so absurd that i often wonder if the motivations are deeper than just ignorancesexismracism  religion  and political ideology the ultimate consequences of interfering with women s health rights are so obviously ass backwards and to the detriment of society it makes my head explode  it would nt surprise me if many of these bastard politicians view such actions as a long term investment in their criminal justice systems and keeping their prisons filled  among other sinister motives  do these states  by chance  happen to reap any federal benefits from rampant populations growth  i know many red states get heavy federal subsidies it feels like there s more to it than concern for the  sanctity of life   perhaps i underestimate racism in the south ,d0245io,politics,news,1455645041,wo_ob,5,0,1,112,0

back when hillary ran against obama  i remember thinking that she would make a better president than obama  but that she could never win a general election i do nt remember disliking her  even when she went a bit negative  this year it s a bit different i still believe she is absolutely incapable of winning a general election the republicans just hate her too much the base will come out to vote against her  even if they wo nt come out to support trump or cruz or whatever empty suit they nominate  but this year  i m finding myself really disliking clinton on so many counts  her platform simply wo nt solve our problems her motives are clearly all about hillary her rhetoric is so crafted to mislead she s attacking a guy who has refused to attack her back  hillary is pretending to steal bernie s issues  without having the decency to actually do so she offers weaker versions of his plans  but claims they are stronger and she uses cheap rhetorical tricks to obfuscate the differences between her plans and bernies it s not a battle of ideas for her it s just manipulation and taking advantage of the confusion she s deliberately causing  she s clearly taken too much money from too many special interests to ever be impartial  let alone tough on their industries  worst of all is her condescending tone when speaking to young people she refuses to acknowledge their problems  and does nt seem at all interested in actually courting them she does nt think their votes matter she s sure they ll stay home i would nt mind all this if her actual platform and agenda was going to improve their lives but it wo nt  because has no understanding of their problems  i just ca nt vote for hillary i just ca nt she s a bad  bad candidate she will be a terrible president  i might get out and vote against donald trump getting the nuclear codes  if it comes to that but i m praying bernie pulls off the upset ,d026xeh,politics,news,1455648802,flossdaily,357,0,3652,141581,1

keep just these recent decisions in mind where justice scalia was a part of the 54 majority that could have different outcomes if he is replaced by a democrat president   in a 54 majority limits in mccutcheon v fec  the court invalidated the aggregate contribution limits that were first put in place by the federal election campaign act of 1971   in atamp  t mobility v concepcion  the 54 majority ruled that corporations can effectively mandate arbitration agreements that preclude consumers from bringing class actions to combat fraud and enforce their rights without access to an impartial judge and jury  and without the resources to go it alone in arbitration  people typically abandon their claims and corporate wrongdoers are never held accountable many states enacted consumer protection laws to curtail the pernicious practice of forced arbitration  but in concepcion the supreme court held that such laws are preempted by an old federal statute from 1925 called the federal arbitration act  faa    the 54 majority in michigan v epa overturned epa regulations safeguarding communities from toxic pollution by power plants that causes up to 11000 premature deaths each year essentially  the court  s decision places a premium on businesses  bottom lines over public health and limits the epa  s ability to regulate hazardous air pollutants over the objections of corporate interests   in ledbetter v goodyear tire and rubber co  the 54 court majority made it virtually impossible to bring a claim of longrunning sex or race discrimination in pay under title vii of the 1964 civil rights act  a decision later reversed by a congressional statute a woman had been paid less than her male peers for 20 years and the court stated she had no right to bring a lawsuit for equal pay because she failed to file suit within 180 days of the first discrimination  even though she had no way of learning about the discrimination until years later   in davis v fec  a 54 majority overturned the  millionaire  s amendment   congress  s effort to level the playing field in the political process and reduce the influence of wealth on elections by increasing the contribution limits to candidates facing selffunded opponents   in florence v board of chosen freeholders  the 54 court majority ruled that local officials can stripsearch anyone accused of any crime  even if there is no reason to suspect contraband or concealed weapons  and can not be sued for invasion of privacy   the 54 majority in shelby county v holder overturned a key section of the 1965 voting rights act  making it much harder to protect against discrimination in voting not only did the majority dismissively reject tens of thousands of pages of congressional findings supporting the coverage formula contained in section 4 of the nearlyunanimous 2006 reauthorization of the vra  but the opinion was noted for failing to provide any legal or constitutional rationale for its holding nothing in the text of the constitution was cited to justify the court  s novel decision to strike down the cornerstone of american civil rights law   the 54 majority in leegin creative leather products inc v psks inc overruled a 96yearold rule that had made vertical price fixing per se illegal under federal antitrust law overturning the almost century of antitrust law  the court decided that manufacturers and retailers could sometimes engage in pricefixing in dissent  justice breyer cited studies estimating that this change in law would cost consumers  300 billion a year in increased prices on everyday items   a 53 majority  since justice sotomayor recused herself  in american express co v italian colors restaurant ruled that a smallbusiness owner could not bring an antitrust lawsuit challenging a large corporation  s alleged abuse of its monopoly power  even though  it was claimed  it was that very monopoly power that allowed the corporation to force an agreement to arbitrate and not litigate all complaints against it the court upheld the use of forced arbitration clauses even if it made enforcing federal laws like the sherman act practically impossible in dissent  justice kagan explained that the court  s decision allows   t  he monopolist    to use its monopoly power to insist on a contract effectively depriving its victims of all legal recourse   the 54 majority in burwell v hobby lobby stores  inc decided that forprofit corporations can claim religious rights and can exempt themselves from federal laws requiring them to provide contraceptive coverage to employees the majority also rewrote the religious freedom restoration act  with potentially dangerous consequences for lgbt and other americans   in parents involved in community schools v seattle school district  the 54 court majority prohibited school districts from attempting voluntarily to promote school desegregation through student reassignment plans   in walmart v dukes  approximately one million female walmart employees tried to file a classaction lawsuit over claims of sex bias the 54 decision by the court made it nearly impossible for a class of workers to use for widespread corporate misbehavior that comes in the form of unwritten policies essentially  every worker has to bring their own individual claim  making walmart and other large companies realistically judgment proof to these types of claim   in two 54 decisions  solid waste agency of northern cook county v us army corps of engineers and rapanos v united states  the court effectively took many waterways outside the protection of the clean water act  even though pollution from these waterways can dirty the drinking water of 117 million americans as a result of the court  s decision  1500 major pollution investigations have been halted  and epa actions against water polluters have fallen by 50    in national federation of independent business v sebelius which upheld the patient protection and affordable care act under the taxing power of congress  a 54 majority on the court overturned 70 years of precedent dealing with the commerce clause prior to this case  the court had held that congress has the authority to regulate activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce in the area of economic activities   substantial effect  can be found based on the cumulative impact of the activity across the country for example  the supreme court held that congress could use its commerce clause authority to prohibit individuals from cultivating and possessing small amounts of marijuana for personal medicinal use because marijuana is bought and sold in interstate commerce the relationship between health care coverage and the national economy is even stronger and more readily apparent the court had also said that congress could use its commerce power to forbid hotels and restaurants from discriminating based on race  even though their conduct was refusing to engage in commercial activity under an unbroken line of precedents stretching back 70 years  congress has the power to regulate activities that  taken cumulatively  have a substantial effect on interstate commerce people not purchasing health insurance unquestionably has this effect this ruling  if a liberal justice is replaced with someone like scalia  could overturn vast amounts of social programs like medicare and worker protections  on the other hand  occasionally a justice like justice kennedy has sided with the liberal justices to produce 54 decisions that would be in danger if a republican wins the white house and a liberal justice dies or retires while they are in office   in obergefell v hodges  a 54 court majority ruled that the constitution protects the right of samesex couples to marry   a 54 majority in texas department of housing and community affairs v the inclusive communities project upheld the longstanding interpretation of the federal fair housing act to prohibit practices with unjustified discriminatory impact   in massachusetts v epa  a 54 court majority upheld the authority of the epa to regulate greenhouse gases   a 54 majority upheld voterpassed nonpartisan redistricting reform in arizona state legislature v arizona independent redistricting commission   in williamsyulee v the florida bar  a 54 majority upheld a ban on state judicial candidates directly soliciting campaign funds   in boumediene v bush  a 54 majority ruled that prisoners detained in guantanamo can file habeas corpus petitions to challenge their detention   a 54 majority in alabama democratic conference v alabama invalidated a state redistricting scheme that used race to harm minority voters   a 54 majority ruled in favor of workers  rights in csx transportation v mcbride ruling

this  and another article  really describe to me the difference between clintonera thought and sanders thought clinton economics is to have unfettered capitalist coupled with biggovernment welfare in the form of transfer payments to those harmed by capitalism sanders favors a more fair form of capitalism that is restrained  designed to not allow people to become billionaires instead of transfer payments funded by taxes  he would rather see more opportunities with their cost baked into the pricing of goods and services  i prefer the sanders approach because it is tenable everyone hates high taxes to fund welfare payments it is better to put more people to work with an economy that is designed to do this rather than one designed to make a few people insanely rich ,d02ekdt,politics,news,1455658972,MoonBatsRule,1,0,1,11325,0

one problem that will need to be addressed before even mr sanders  economic prescriptions can work  our currency is overloaded  in a computer program  if the programmer tries to do too many things with one variable  the result is sure failure humans overload their currencies in the same way and to the same result  they try to make their currencies do too many things at the same time a medium of exchange  a medium of wealth storage  a means of demonstrating success  etc this can be fixed by using specific currencies for specific things  a saving currency  a trading currency  an investment currency  etc make tax policies specific to the uses of the various currencies and to their conversions from one type to another this would require secure electronic currencies  on a related note  what is a good way to really screw up a government  hoard their currency or otherwise take it out of circulation  the us and other governments are experiencing this now as multinational corporations stash currencies in outofreach banks governments are foolish to allow these people  aka  corporations   to undermine their currencies in this manner ,d02p4f9,politics,news,1455674793,Tweakers,1,0,1047,17448,1

there is only one issue i have with what he said and perhaps some on who has a higher degree in economics than i do can explain why i m wrong  i have a minor in economics but does nt increased capital requirements mean banks have much less money to lend thus reducing the amount of money in existence  in economic terms anyway  and thus inflating the value of the dollar  since there is less of it in circulation  causing exports to weaken and imports to strengthen and if my understanding serves one of the problems of the recession was that bank credit simply dried up would nt this idea lead to a similar thing happening  also how small are we talking of making these banks  because economies of scale are still important to keep in mind when redistributing the banking system ,d02q89u,politics,news,1455676507,Joemaster240,1,0,128,869,0

the 3 sectors of the economy that have seen annual doubledigit inflation are housing  education  and medical  and these are the sectors that have seen the most government intervention and subsidies once politicians consider these things to be a  right  of all americans  regardless of their credit rating  education  income  savings  prices skyrocket as available supply plummets  bernie sanders will only succeed in ensuring that these 3 sectors become even more prohibitively expensive to the point nobody will afford them without going through the federal government for assistance ,d02v1r3,politics,news,1455684654,phernoree,1,0,3648,11889,0

if bernie wins the nomination  then the american people win regardless of who wins the election  at least the spectre of the clinton s will be gone  hillary will promise anything to anybody to get elected  but bernie just speaks his mind and sticks to his principles and he will continue to do that whether or not he is nominated by his party  or not because he is truthful and committed  the same can not be said of hillary ,d02v2ds,politics,news,1455684688,oddlycurious1,1,0,243,131,0

idk guys i ve been going on this subreddit after the nh primaries and this whole place seems so 1 dimensional to me  did you guys just forget about what that reporter brought up about what happened in 2006  obama was one of these senate asshats who wanted to obstruct  through filibuster  the appointment of alito  this is nt a partisan problem this is a political structure problem  i guess this is just the problem with large communities and this type of voting structure  upvotes and downvotes   everybody repeats the same idealogies  the same headlines  the same thoughts ,d02v4f8,politics,news,1455684795,MelsonNandela,1,0,3,121,0

as a grad student who is treated for bipolar disorder and depression  healthcare is probably the biggest issue for me aside from foreign policy  my field of study   i have 3 more years on my parent s health insurance plan before i have to get my own while based on my current income under the aca i would qualify for substantial subsidies  i still ca nt afford the deductible  without insurance my medication is roughly  1200 a month that s what i fucking make in a month and the fact that the average insurance plan requires you to pay between  2500 and  5000 before they ll cover anything that makes the medication that i need to be stable unaffordable for me after congress removed the public option from the aca they may as well have just not passed the bill at all  hillary clinton does nt even have a fucking healthcare plan sure  she was once a supporter of universal health care but that ship sailed a long time ago  frankly if sanders does nt get the nomination i m more likely to vote for trump than clinton  largely for moral reasons the fact that she considers henry kissenger her mentor and admires the man is flat out disturbing and calls into question whether or not she really considers her iraq war vote as a mistake or not her views on global interventionism are aligned with the neocons and in many ways sanders has more in common with trump than he does clinton ,d02v5wg,politics,news,1455684871,Im_Not_A_Socialist,1,0,6601,1805,0
