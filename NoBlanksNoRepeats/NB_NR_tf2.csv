after reading the cactus canyon thread  where it s in beta since forever   i have a few ideas for our beloved tf2 team to repurpose more of the beta and empty servers  1  one is as i had mentioned in other threads  an other mode  server which would host tc  arena  pd maps  and take out doomsday and put into these ones that itself would be enough of a map cycle to constitute a large enough server for people to play on these do nt need much since not a lot of people would play it  but maybe at most 15  of the valve servers would be enough for this  2  another idea is to make beta servers  currently only for 247 asteroid and cc  for workshop maps that are in beta status unfortunately  custom maps do nt get much shine  as most people would just play whatever map that s in valve servers currently only nonvalve servers  ie community or custom servers  have custom maps  and a good percentage of them are established custom maps that had been played for a long time or tf2mapsnet s gamedays or people would just download the map and check themselves  at this point  after 3  or 4 if you count halloween 2015  contracts you start to see some of the issues pop up unfinished andor not wellbalancedwip maps are becoming official and while new maps being added officially is always nice  the tough break ones have exploits  readjustments  missing things happen in the maps  personally i feel that it s because these maps do not get played much by a larger pool of players  or at all by the general public that any feedback to the map makers are slow or very few that the mapmaker could nt get enough feedback to improve on hisher map note that at this point i am not saying the tf2 mapping community by itself is bad  they are an excellent bunch that makes maps for a game that s been almost out for 10 years there s also map critique people who goes thru the maps thoroughly  i did some before when i was active in tf2maps   but sometimes  perhaps more voices being heard is a good thing  which is why i want to suggest that valve make beta workshop map rotations  say 23 maps a quarteryear or every 2 months put into beta servers along with asteroid and cc  sorry 247ers   this also utilizes the workshop feature of steam where you would subscribe to these maps as well  and then you can go to the workshop page for feedback after playing them on the valve beta servers so far most workshop comments are  this looks cool  and some occasional feedback about the map itself  or a spooky skeleton so adding them to valve servers would add a lot more exposure to the mapmaker on getting more feedback  of any type  mind you   which allows himher to use the feedback to fix or improve the map  however this involves a bit more work from the tf2 team to go thru the workshop maps and decide which maps to put in the servers and the quality varies by a lot  so i think the map should at least be in beta status  and it s recommended that it also has a tf2mapsnet map thread opened as well    tl  dr    1 add other modes  servers 2 add workshop maps into beta servers on a bimonthlyquarterly rotation for better custom map quality what do you guys think  edit  some wordings added,4623uh,tf2,gaming,1455623204,penpen35,23,0,2862,4581,0

i have a theory on why the sales have been so littlei would post it in the thread but it became a huge text wall   go all the way down for a resume    do nt dimish tough break overall  by itself it  s a very good update it  s got better weapon skins  it  s got more skins  it  s got maps  it  s got better and more diverse missions if you take all of that in consideration it is even better than gun mettle  my favorite update so far   so valve don  t think tb was a bad update because it isn  t it  s good  your developers did a very good job  the reason why it didn  t live up to the expectations were     1  too many updates     while having constant updates  contracts and prizes are awesome  tough break didn  t give us enough room to breath in  gun mettle  july 2 to september 30th  2015  invasion  october 6  2015 until november 9  2015  halloween  october 28 up to november 12  2015  tough break  december 17  running until march 31  2016  as you can see there were even overlapped updates and each one required keys to open up the cases i bought invasion pass and felt incredibly disappointed as soon as the free halloween update came out i was totally drawn to it  it was simply better and left all invasion maps   one can not be continuously paying for stuff thrown off on their table   the first 3 update have been released one after another  so that explains why gm and invasion had more sold passes even though invasion was undoubtly the worst and weakest of all major updates released last year and tb even though  better  than gm sold way less     2  the mechanics of prize in all those contracts are bad   since gm and that really didn  t change so far   by doing an informal research i will say 40  of all rewards are cases pay 6 dollars to receive something to pay 3 dollars for it let  s forget about the  sell as soon as the campaign start in order to profit  for a while because   if 50  of the users assume this position the goal is literally and quickly destroyed because there will be tons of cases eventually that will drastically turn ridiculously cheap   one can simply want the reward   for some reason you may miss the first daysweeks an lose the profit besides i want to talk about the  prize  itself   the huge contradiction of paying for  better and rare  weapons when in actuality the weapons received for free are the real deal yes  once the weapon is dropped it  s over that  s it  they are that forever  while by opening cases you are guaranteed to get weapons after the campaign is over there are still thousands of cases around the world because they won  t stop dropping even after the campaign is over  for a while   that way the top shelf weapons are way better than any pyroland weapon because they are one of kind  ie  if 40  of the rewards are of the pure weapons  then around 20  are gentlemanne  let  s say so   then 15 of them is actually factory new which makes less than 4   we also have the grade factor which are 4  however take in consideration that some sets are more desired than the others then some harvestgentlemann would be wayyy more desired than any weapon you are sure to get if you open it up with a key   new skins for old weapons  players possess every single weapon from those campaigns since they have the game is instaled besides that we have reskin for some of them we have botkillers we have australium we had gun mettle  now valve is throwing out even more skins for the very same weapons  cosmetics are different because they are one of a kind tough break would be   way more sucessful   if they had added   skins for other weapons     we don  t care about grades  but we do about the tier if you go for cosmetics  cratecase  you know you can get any cosmetic and eventually the one you wish for now we have a larger set of possibilities which have 80  chance of being scratcheddished color dished covered in blood  so you  re telling me to buy something i already have but with lower value  scratched  that changes from my original stock only after 15 second  all stocks are clean  lean and flawless i don  t even think cases should have battlescarred weapons   rare unusual is normal  but rare stranges  the rate of strange weapons should be increased in order to make the campaignprizes more desirable the rate is still quite low  remember it valve  we already have what you are asking us to pay for since the beginning forever   weapons  weapons and weapons  again  we already have all of them comestics otherwise are rare and offer a new glimpse of interest and uniqueness for all by having cosmetics and skins in the reward pool instead of cases only could make people eager for contracts and campaigns and adds a new fresh air to the updates  i hope valve reads this and consider all i said in order to make the next campaigns better    tl  dr     we had too many campaigns which reduced the appeal for tough break and many skins for the same weapons  we already have  too quickly the rewards for contracts are bad for the players and ther is not many reasons to keep uncrating cases we need skins for nonstock weapons and other prizes for the contracts  like also adding communitycreated cosmetics  ,462tpu,tf2,gaming,1455635392,daniellua1,36,0,0,0,

guys  we got ta really look at what has been added into team fortress 2 these past years passes  now i now what you re wondering  cherry  why do passes matter so much to this discussion    well  let s take a look at what has happened in the recent few months  it has been 3 years since we got a major  content wise update given to mann vs machine  not counting the update adding the ability to find aussies in any advanced or expert tour this already gave me a bad feeling why bother adding new maps if you can find the aussies on any advanced or expert tour now  what new prize can we introduce that can top an australium weapon  i do nt know  maybe adding more australium themed weapons  they ve only scratched the small surface of australiums  acting as if  hey  that s it guys we ca nt top the golden pan anymore   so what  i do nt want a golden pan i want a golden degreaser or golden jagsomething  cosmetics have dropped in the amount we ve gotten in crates or updates the last update we got that had a high number of cosmetics was the smissmas 2014 update  two years ago remember when you had to deal with waiting for the price to drop on the most popular hat  remember when you actually had the chance to get the most popular hat  remember when they provided other hats as well to deal with the popular ones  and actually gave more community members a chance to get their work in the game  weapons i m not sure if i wan na touch this one i understand it s hard to create new weapons and put them into the game  with having to balance them  make them coexist with other weapons and work with other weapons  reskins here we go remember when they gave us a reskin but than put them in the craft or drop system  so what do all these have to do with passes  ai nt it obvious  as grampa soldier once said  it s the oldest trick in the book money   with passes  all you have to do is just  make your own skins  slap a rarity system from cs  go on them  do the same with cosmetics  and you re set for life  why do i have to shell out 32 cosmetics that i get profit from the crate opening be slightly rare  when i can bump the rarity to a high tier strange or unusual  why unbox 3 or 4 crates when we can get those youtube unboxing tier unboxs  why make a slight profit off a reskin than release it into the craft and drop system  when i can say it s elite or commando grade  and keep making money off the unboxes  in conclusion from what i ve observed  valve does nt want to put in the time and effort for the community to actually make improvements on old gamemodes and weapons  when they can just shell out the cs  go system instead  the real question is  who is to blame  was it the corporation wanting to make more money for themselves  or was it the response to a community who used to ask when the new weapon would be out  we are sick of hats  whens the new map  now i ll admit  passes have brought in a few new maps and another chance for the creative side of the community to shine with weapon skins and maps however  some stuff like weapon rarity or cosmetic rarity might turn content creators away or prevent them from getting a chance to be put into team fortress 2  this has all just been my opinion throughout the years of team fortress i ve been playing  and i m kinda sad to see the  old  way of updates slowly fading away  leave your thoughts in the comments below  positive or negative ,464y80,tf2,gaming,1455661210,CherryThePanPyro,4,0,342,923,0

besides pyro  the only class i consider to be lacking in performance is heavy  who has a number of problems without a medic or a sandwich  heavy has problems performing his job as an offensivedefensive tank the whole point of heavy is to be the center of attention and absorb lots of damage while your team attacksdoes their jobs if your team does nt have a medic  you re screwed 300 is still a lot of hp  but it does nt go very far if you do nt have a medic healing you i think it would be a good idea to give heavy a  20  damage resistance while spun up  on all of his miniguns  or at least everyone of them except the tomislav  which could have a new stat  like extra movement speed or something the natascha and brass beast already have those  but stock is usually superior to both it would give heavy a better edge in fights  and i think it would be very good for him to have some sort of natural damage resistance i also think he could have a small hp regen while spun up and crouching  since he s basically a sitting duck while spun up and crouching  literally  and it could give him some more survivability spies and snipers would still screw you over  but i think it would be fair i would also like it if they brought his minigun back to it s old state  without the weird drop in accuracydamage for the 1st second of revup  and restore it s accuracy however  to balance it out  his minigun takes slightly longer to rev  about one second   it might need another change to keep it balanced  but i ll leave that up to your discussion ,465nmf,tf2,gaming,1455670915,CaptainKappa14,5,0,1,-9,0

great gameplay  the spire and mid point are a great example of how to balance around scout  demo  and soldier s mobility by giving them ways to use it to the full  while also giving plenty of cover to medic however the sniper sightline game can be a little strong at times easily one of the best 6s maps in terms of gameplay  visually  i do nt feel like it hits the overall tf2 theme very well  though rather than the industrial blu v agricultural red stylings of many other tf2 maps  which feature wood and sheet metal to spice up the show  it s just clean concrete interspersed with grassy dirt all the way through  sort of like gorge   a disclaimer  though variation between maps is a good idea  and if all maps stuck to the same formula the game would be a lot more boring however  if you re playing process a lot  it can still start to feel a bit washedout after a while  this map is sort of like the polar opposite of 2fort  and of course  like many things  that comes down to personal preference more than objective fact but one thing that can be said for certain is it can lead to balanced 6s combat ,czym93q,tf2,gaming,1455384703,remember_morick_yori,5,0,234,13881,0

spawn timers are carefully tuned for game balance  attackers have shorter respawn timers than defenders  times vary between maps and points based on how long it takes to get back in the action and how easy it is to take a point  good players can use respawn timers to track enemy position  eg a spy just died  you estimate when he ll spawn so you can guess where he s headed while invisible and know how long you have to worry before he s in position to do damage again  tweaking the system might be awkward with wave based spawns too that system is really good at forcing teamwork by having players spawn and push together most newbies that spawned alone would hold w as soon as they spawned even if their whole team was dead ,d013pyv,tf2,gaming,1455571618,UnoriginalUsername39,3,0,1,2989,0

i agree with your message in general and as a sniper main i have to appreciate that really nice run of kills and if i were on the opposing team would probably end up really hating you because you would be killing me so many times  one caveat though  playing games like you want is great  and i do nt mind the guy who spends half the round taunting or the spycrab or the competitive scout or the new sniper who is trying to shoot through the glass  or the spy that is always killing me  ok i hate that spy a little bit   but the chat in your video brought something up that should be mentioned  i draw the line when people are hacking  i do nt think you are  it s pretty obvious when players are and i am also accused of hacking when i m doing really well   play however you want  enjoy the game and all  but when you play against others please do nt use hacks  do whatever you want in single player  but there s no quicker way to end the fun for everyone else than using hacks maybe that s how some people have fun  but i ve been in countless servers that were really even and both teams were really into it and then the server was cleared when a hacker showed up and just started dominating everyone ,d01e36x,tf2,gaming,1455587775,abrahamdrinkin,17,0,568,5756,0

yeah wellthey probably have other priorities now and both beta maps are nt in great needs to be released sadly  however i want to suggest that since they have beta servers  they can put some community workshop beta maps on rotation  eg two maps per month  so map makers can get more feedback and coverage  and players can try something new obviously the tf team would choose the maps to put on  so that s a bit of extra work there ,d01euyx,tf2,gaming,1455588972,penpen35,3,0,2862,4581,0

the reason why tough break did nt do as well as gun mettle is because gun mettle was the first campaign  it was really exciting  and people bought the pass because they thought they d enjoy it more than they did invasion only did as well as it did because it was communitydeveloped and incredibly cheap even if they waited until next summer  you d have seen the numbers go down substantially  that said  i personally agree that they should ve waited on releasing another campaign until the next summer i hope they wait longer between campaigns this time ,d02768z,tf2,gaming,1455649125,MastaAwesome,10,0,2781,11497,0

even in 6s engineers are worth something  last holds  i do nt know much about hl  but i do know that engineers are definitely more important there than in 6s if you enjoy engineer  then play it if your team is nt supporting you and helping you improve then you should find a new one  as umiauw62 says  ,d028gk0,tf2,gaming,1455650870,Ymir_from_Saturn,17,0,290,42580,0
that guy honestly sounds like a bit of a douche  in hl  of course good engineers matter  even if not as much as some other classes  because both teams are made to run one any increase in skill your engineer has that the enemy does nt is a bonus to your team  in 6s  engineers do matter a lot less though because explosive classes are always run 99  of the time  medics do their best to utilise ubercharge to the full  and generally you will have less time to set up a sentry as well engineers do still shine at lasts  where their defensive power makes them useful for wasting an enemy uber and shutting down scouts  but if you want to play 6v6 as an engineer main you re going to need to be able to play other classes for the 80  of the time where an engineer is nt that great  in matchmaking  nobody knows what will be good yet maybe engineers will be the most important class probably not ,d028gox,tf2,gaming,1455650874,remember_morick_yori,29,0,234,13881,0

never played comp  but i ll tell you my two cents  engineer is different that the other classes maybe with the exception of the medic  engineer has different priorities than shooting i know that most of the time  you re limited to gunslinger for the mobility and you do nt have to worry about rebuilding buildings  but your first priority is nt to shoot a guy  but build a sentry on defense or on last as offense  you need your buildings to get a foothold and prevent the enemy from pushing you and your team back or capping  also  teleporters koth  pl  and cp will always need you to build a teleporter  your team leader is a douche  but not because of his arrogance it s because he is off doing other shit while you are prioritizing and getting your buildings up plus  he mindlessly uses your buildings if every team counted how many times an engineer helped them  stopped a push  used a tele  used a dispenser  etc   then you could rack up your usefulness points  engineer is just a different class ,d02bd0g,tf2,gaming,1455654722,CheesyPantz,-4,0,0,0,

gt  one of the coordinators of the hl team i m in is a 6s player  and downright dismisses engineers i ve gotten a littletono feedback on my playing because simply   i do nt care  and while i ve tried to make engineer have a good name in the past  on rtf2   i m questioning my main is it time to just give up my favorite class  and become a boring soldier main  i have no clue    protip    bad leaders are a dime a dozen  i m sitting out this season  so forgive me if i m mistaken  but did nt ugc just get done playing steel or steel is the upcoming map being played  that map  of all maps  is the one where i say engie is absolutely pivotal you have your team escort engie with a level 3 sentry into the e cap room  suddenly the defending team has a huge problem on their hands and tons of pressure to deal with only took a couple steel games for me to notice a pattern of this  and soon after i was taking special care to watch my engie and offering to go with him to guard him and buy him some room to get his sentry up  obviously when the combo itself was headed that direction anyways of course   get a sentry in e  suddenly most of their classes can not actively pressure e to stop your cap  and only a couple sightlines or classes can continue harrassing the point even if a spy is fully confident he can get the sap  the respawn time for anyone that s died fucking hurts even the best spy can fail a sap attempt  and a failure there is 20 more seconds of cap time even if they successfully deny e  the effort that s been demanded of them to do so means they ve had to surrender the other active point  largely thanks to the sentry  do nt let this kind of shit get you down  there s all kinds of bias from players against everything possible  and constant claims that this or that class is worthless or easy tons of 6s players hate hl classes  tons of hl players have a grudge against 6s classes  etc etc etc for engie  i find it s common for a lot of 6s players to dislike the class because a sentry can deny a scout and a jumper completely  which is obviously quite dull for them the result is plenty of claims the class is easy since you have an aimbot in my opinion  most of those people are simply trying to validate how pro they are by claiming their class and their work is leagues above that of their comrades the reality is that each class provides it s own challenges and strengths it s all just fragile egos needing reassurance and validation  and honestly  not hating on your friend as a person  but realize many people want to be a leader for the  prestige  of being a leader the people that actually have what it takes to lead are a small fraction of the players that want to lead so they can gloat and talk about what a tactical genius they think they are i would expect a leader to have at least some sense for each class and how to best utilize them  and if i m correct that currently ugc is playing steel and this guy s response to how to best utilize engie is  i do nt care   then i seriously question his leadership engie would be a fucking cornerstone of any steel strats i d use  personally ,d02dg6c,tf2,gaming,1455657493,AFlyingNun,5,0,3181,37590,1

engineer is the cornerstone of a successful defense on payload having a teleporter  dispenser  and sentry is immeasurably important however  rather like medics go unnoticed in pubs  engineers have a tendency to get overlooked competitively  one of the psychological reasons i think this is true is that engineers are usually not the people that their teams see when being assisted by them no  the team sees the engineer s dispenser or teleporter therefore they are less likely to attribute the help to the engineer himself  another reason is that on 6s  engineer is a situational offclass this is the most natural designation for 6s  partially because of engineers  lower effectiveness on 6s maps  and to make the most efficient use of the 6 players you are allowed to field  i can assure you that in highlander maps  you are worth it to your team  and play an essential  but often unrealized support role ,d02epi0,tf2,gaming,1455659159,Wittywidi,1,0,0,0,

it s true that engies may not get all the action but from my limited knowledge about them i would say they are important as any other support class is  you dispense health and ammo  blessings from the sky for demoman and heavy  and with a good sentry you make it hard for other team to push through to capture the point  if anybody in your team says engie is no good then let them try to play without you and i bet they will start missing that lovely dispenser and the pushes will be so much easier for enemy team due to no sentry stopping them if there are too many toxic and mood breaking players in your team then i would suggest looking for another team that will appreciate having a dedicated engie in their team also remember than engie is also only as good as his team is so if your team is shit and do nt protect you then it can be very frustrating to play an engie and that is one of the reason i do nt play on much in valve pubs as constant destroying just kills my spirit lol  but really do nt give up on your dream of becoming an engie main because people like you that main  less popular  classes are becoming rare and only people that have real passion to play their class can be truly successful in their team  also looking around to improve your skills and searching for engie demo reviews will also make your team mates noticing your value in the team one of the best engies is sigafoo so watching his streams and maybe even demo revievs if he does them  not sure  and there is also a youtube called uncle dane that has many fun yet educational videos about engie and lately he even reviewed his own demo from his own team scrims and this way you will learn a thing or 2 from it  ,d02f1zl,tf2,gaming,1455659608,Hreidmar1423,1,0,0,0,

well  you re more important than pyro and spy  because you can make dispensers for your power classes to resupply from   full disclosure  i play hl pyro   but on a serious note  engie  along with spy and pyro  is probably one of the least important classes  and the higher up you go the more this is true   that being said  there are still things you can do  and do them well and if you really enjoy engie then you should just stick with it  and get a mentor  a gold engie  to look over demos with you to actually give you more feedback  rather than some steel peer who prolly does nt really have experience to give you suggestions anyways though it would nt hurt to learn how to play scout and soldier because they ll help you with your shotgun dm and wrangled rocket damage  also i used to have a dude on my team who would be all lolhl and i eventually had to cut him because his lolhl attitude made him a terrible teammate who could nt take a loss in the  inferior  game mode even though his complete and utter lack of game sense was partially responsible for us losing in the first place there are plenty of 6s players who play hl and are nt fucking shitlords acting like they re being martyred into some game mode they do nt even want to play  so my advice is give him a big ol  fat one and start looking for a team with more mature people on it ,d02fqah,tf2,gaming,1455660541,Piperita,0,0,137,1663,0

heya chris  i d like to point out  yes  engineers are very good in highlander however  this is mainly due to the class restrictions that highlander puts in place  giving each class equal roles  this  of course  tweaks game balance to make some classes more significant than in normal gameplay circumstances so i would argue that yes  engineer has worth  in highlander since you re forced to have an engineer on both teams  you ca nt really deny that a good engineer will help the team more than a bad one  him dismissing engineer in   highlander   is stupid however  him dismissing engineer in practically any other gamemode is somewhat acceptable  be it pubs  6v6  4v4  or anything that does nt force you to play offensive engi at all times   this is mainly due to most classes being better than engineer on offense  but engineer is still better than the others for defense the only way that offensive engineer is viable is when you literally ban the ability to switch to the other 8 classes    conclusion    he can bitch about engineer being a useless turd to the team anywhere except highlander however  since he s bitching about hl engineers  he s in the wrong because engineers are nt being a burden to the team on offense  and are contributing members due to there literally being no other option  engineer  as a class  is nt worth  it 247 in  unrestricted gameplay   however  highlander pretty much makes everything used 247  so that everything is viable 247 regardless of how the original balance is ,d02hc2f,tf2,gaming,1455662813,TF2SolarLight,3,0,780,4876,0

the basic idea of  lets put grades on items   is a fine idea  it s just that valve did nt play out the idea correctly they did it  but they did nt do it  good   i think the root of the problem is that the main focus of gun mettle was rebalances  maps  and introducing contracts so the skins and the grades were kind of lazily put together  and people were so quick to ask for a gun mettle 2 that valve just ended up copying and pasting everything into tough break  so  tough break resulted in really sloppy rebalances  4  arguably  poorly made maps  and the only real highlight of the update was betterlooking skins  if we put gun mettle and tough break against each other  gun mettle would win every time  because gm completely  transformed  tf2 if you showed august 2015 tf2 to february 2015 tf2  people would go nuts but  if you showed january 2016 tf2 to october 2015 tf2  they would nt because tough break did nt really shake the game up  it just sort of stuck some sticks in the game and said   eh  that s good   i really think after match making is released  we ll see the  old  style updates return at least  i hope that s the case  because if things stay this way tf2 might really lose its spirit for me  which is probably why scream fortress 7 was my favorite update of 2015  ,d02ipj6,tf2,gaming,1455664871,GhoulBones,5,0,24,117,0

might as well toss my two cents in  although it s a little late to the thread  for me  the best thing with the contractoriented updates is the contracts themselves it s almost undeniably fun to get a new contract and then complete that sucker gives you a good reason to play  as if you needed one anyhow   where valve got it wrong  1 too many freakin  crates at first  you could immediately sell the crates for pretty good amounts on the market and they were one of the more desireable drops later in the process  they become irritating to get when you want a weapon and the crates are only selling for maybe a scrap or two at first  it s  oh boy  crate  awesome   sell  kaching   about halfway through  it seems you re getting about 50  crates and it becomes  crap  another one of these   and the question becomes whether to unbox and find crap  selling the crate for squat on the market  or just deleting it  2 crates should never  ever  ever have crappy condition skins ever there is an undeniable sense of feeling screwed when you complete a contract  drop a crate  open it  because you re stupid  like me   and end up with a shitty skin worth  05 that just bites and makes you not want to open crates when a contract completion weapon can be more valuable than an unboxed weapon  the system is not working right if you open a crate  the skin you get should be top quality with maybe a 30  or so chance of strange  not potentially shit quality with what seems like about as much chance of a strange as there is of unboxing an unusual i ve unboxed way too many contract crates and ended up with a grand total of one strange which leads me to  3 the incidence of strange weapons in the crates is ridiculously low i think there s a damn good argument for a return to  weapon from a crate is gon na be strange  again  you spend  250 plus tax to open the digital box  you want something of value it does nt have to be a wash or more than you put in  but it should have some value to it especially since you already paid  6 just to be eligible to get it again  it sucks so bad to effectively spend  850 plus tax for a chance to get and open a crate  and then find a nonstrange piece of shit well worn skin it s like gaben just takes your money then slaps you in the face and laughs  4 duplicate skins  especially from crates duplicate skins from a contract once in a while is maybe okay  but overall multiple copies of the same piece of shit just sucks this gets even worse if you get duplicates from crates this badly needs a fix  i ca nt help but think you can still have rare  seldom unboxed items while also largely avoiding duplicates being unboxed  number 4 here was edited for coherency  so in conclusion  i really like the contract concept and find it definitely keeps me coming back to the game i really just about hate the frequency of crate  rewards  especially when the chance of unboxing a strange is very low and the chance of getting a shit to middling quality skin is very high it gives me the distinct sense of being basically ripped off while valve just kinda shrugs i expect that kind of bullshit from a company like ea i do nt expect or appreciate it from a perceived  good  company like valve ,d02k3vl,tf2,gaming,1455667132,letdogsvote,2,0,8979,410807,1

as uthefinalpancake said before  the lighting on the sniper is a little too much  try rotating the light so that it s only shining on the right half of the sniper some external dark bluewhite lights may help in putting more emphasis on the 2 characters  as for the composition  the scene looks rather empty so it would help if you bring the scout a little closer  if you look at the scout  you can see that his model is stretched  you can prevent this by decreasing the fov  if you right click  then goto render setting  set the dof and fov to override to remove the grains  anyways  this is a good first poster  looking forward to your future works     ,d02m5qg,tf2,gaming,1455670269,Leeman1337,1,0,0,0,

maybe because there would be issues with activating it if the wrong weapon was out like if your frontier justice was out of ammo  you ca nt use the killtaunt but with the taunt menu you could if you had your primary out and you wanted to do your melee taunt  how would that work  quickly switch to melee and back ,d02msu9,tf2,gaming,1455671279,Meester_Tweester,6,0,2652,11692,0

i m late to this thread but  here s the opinion of someone who has been with the game for a while  when gun mettle came out  it was something new for tf2 contracts were a novel idea  but it wore off quick players had been starved for anything new for the game for a while i d look back at the medic update  love amp  war  sniper vs spy  pyromania you know  those updates that had a 3 day count down day 1  the maps day 2  the new weapons  day 3  the new game modes  updates that added a ton of stuff to the game new weapons  strategies etc now it s just  give us  6 for the chance to give us more money to open a crate for a weapon reskin  the first campaign was new and novel  but now it seems like this is the direction valve will go in and the quality updates of the past are long gone it s why i will never buy another campaign pass and i m sure i m not the only one ,d02nuni,tf2,gaming,1455672866,shenrougu,2,0,3634,3647,0

i really do hope we start to get old crates back i really do nt like the idea of paying six dollars  just to pay even more money to unbox and after 850 spent i get a 10 cent skin  it s the reason i did nt buy either pass when they came out i loved gun mettle because it was quite possibly the only update since pyromania that did nt shit on pyro  but unfortunately valve went back on themselves to their pyro nerfing ways when tough break came out i feel like the aspects of the updates that worked were nt even new to begin with  adding maps  changing stats etc  whereas all of the stuff that is actually new  i in fact do nt like to begin with i could nt care less about a flamer skin when i ve got my massively decked out degreaser and i m not forking out a ton of money just to open shitty event specific crates  so in truth  when it boils down to it the only new thing that is somewhat good is the contracts and considering you pay 6 dollars for most of your awards to be said cashgrab cratesno thanks valve  tweak the contracts and give us back old crates please not only that but i was sorely dissapointed this christmas  what could of been a simple 250 to get some new festives  would of died happy for a festive degreaser  instead was 850 for a shitty skin that i would nt of wanted so ruining smissmas is another reason i hate the new system  psfor the love of fuck valve  fix axtinguisher ,d02o4jl,tf2,gaming,1455673282,Pyrimo,1,0,1,724,0

a couple of points  1  the reason skins only come out for  old weapons  is so that you are nt confused as to what gun your enemy is using if i see a skin on the battlefield  i know its just a stock weapon  2  is nt it possible that the contracts are 50  off because valve has figured by now  possibly based on the trend of sales of the gun mettle update  that the overwhelming majority of people who were going to buy a campaign pass at full price have already bought one  dropping the price to half off might get sales from people who were nt going to pay up for the full price  as well as a form of marketing to remind players who were nt paying attentionwere nt active at the start of the campaign that they can still get a contract pass and all the contracts ,d02obzq,tf2,gaming,1455673591,omega319,1,0,0,0,
