i hate to just call it  the racing movie with chris hemsworth  but i do nt know how else to describe it in just a few words it was a very good movie but for some reason it got little widespread attention the movie did less than 100m at the box office and got zero academy award nominations i kinda feel sorry for ron howard and all the other people that were involved with it because i think it deserved so much more recognition than what it got  i think the film was pretty excellent in all categories for those that do nt know  it s based on a true story and follows the rivalry between formula 1 racers niki lauda and james hunt chris hemsworth played james hunt  who was basically the womanizing daredevil driver  whereas niki lauda was the more cold and calculating type  who looked at everything mathematically and only took risks when needed  lauda was played by daniel bruhl  you know him as the sniper in inglourious basterds  and i truly think  without hyperbole  that he is just as good of an actor as christoph waltz or michael fassbender his career is nt as good but his performance as lauda was oscar worthy  and i think he deserved it more than matthew mcconaughey s performance in dallas buyers club matt did well do nt get me wrong  but bruhl really became lauda i remember watching a special feature on the bluray where he said he would be on the phone with the real niki lauda before filming  just asking about all the little details to make it as real as possible and i believe someone even said they played the voiceover narration for a formula 1 fan  and they were unable to tell the difference between him and the real guy  but honestly   the whole cast was perfect   http  wtf1coukwpcontentuploads2013098m7vtxe1024x778jpg   it s actually amazing how they were able to get actors that looked so similar without in any way hurting the quality of the performances because they all knocked it out of the park  it was also extremely well written and directed the screenplay made all the characters three dimensional and established complex relationships between them lauda was very cold and a bit of an asshole but still very good at his job and a decent guy underneath hunt was a self destructive playboy but still likable and had a genuine passion and desire to win in fact  one of my favorite bits of characterization in probably any movie is when chris hemsworth joins the mile high club and stares at himself in the mirror while he s banging the chick it really got you inside his head without saying a word hunt and lauda were rivals but there was still a certain level of respect between them  peter morgan is a great screenwriter and may be my favorite currently working he had previously worked with ron on frostnixon i think it s interesting that both of their collaborations involved the relationships between two men opposing each other  i think that s one reason i liked the movie so much there was no protagonist there was not an antagonist either they were just people and for that reason i rate it higher than a lot of biopics because so many of them shoehorn in bad guys when real life does nt normally have clear cut bad guys this level of ambiguity made  rush  feel so much more real i believe howard said he wanted the film to feel like a race where you cheer each guy on at different times  whether or not they re on the track  but as far as the directing  howard made the race track really come alive everything felt so raw and intense and it still felt this way off the track  there s a very raw scene in a hospital which i wo nt spoil  but it s hard to watch   but i think the best part of the whole movie  and what made it one of the best experiences i ve ever had in a theater  was the sound if it deserved an oscar for anything it was the sound watching the movie on bluray is still enjoyable  and makes you feel like you re watching a race track but when i saw it in theaters  i felt like i was actually on the race track i m so  so glad i was one of the  apparently few  people to see it in theaters because it was an experience that home theaters ca nt match  but i still highly recommend it it really felt like a classic scorsese film the characterization of hunt was similar to marty s usual protagonists and it felt as raw as raging bull i really want scorsese and peter morgan to team up because i think the two would work together well since in some ways he reminds me of paul schrader  i really ca nt recommend  rush  more i definitely think it deserved best picture and it really felt like a modern classic when i saw it i hope it gets more attention over time because it was pretty much everything i could ever want in a movie ,45yhrm,movies,1455567700,MasterLawlz,507,117403,118750,0

i actually really enjoyed the film but while i think i m pretty much on the same page as moore politically  i think his film making suffers from severe bias and  even worse  a lack of much real insight the extra hopefulness this film had made the film much more enjoyable  but unfortunately the film raises more questions that it even tries to answer  so i was curious if anybody has come across any articles of people rebutting the ideas that moore proposes  or explaining about the negative sideeffects that these countries deal with that were overlooked in the film   i just like to balance out documentaries with a contrary perspective  even if i agree with what s being proposed  edit  for the record  i know his films are flawed and that the usa is much larger than many other countries i was mostly curious if people think he s looking at these foreign programs through rosetinted glasses  in respect to their native country  and if so how a better example that i did nt use above  the norwegian  i think  prison system seems absolutely absurd to me but they boast a much lower murder rate it s hard for me to wrap my head around i do nt think it s feasible for the usa to convert to this system tomorrow i m still curious about it though ,464ocx,movies,1455657832,nomefish,7,6466,7952,0

so hear me out here  everyone assumes that days of future past retconned wade wilson from xmen origins and turned him into the wade wilson from deadpool the problem with this is that the past portions of dofp take place in 1973  while the scene with team x in xmen origins takes place in 1979 the wade wilson from xmen origins would have already been born sometime in the 1950 s  maybe even late 40 s   while the wade wilson from deadpool was nt born until sometime in the 80 s  or late 70 s   my headcanon is that the original wade wilson probably abandoned deadpool  gave him up for adoption  or simply passed away while acting as a mercenary i understand that many will think that i m taking details from  deadpool  too seriously  but i think it s fun to think about it  especially when  i love having an overview over the xmen cinematic universe   https  wwwredditcomrmoviescomments26vlqlxmen_visual_timeline_oc   tl  dr  wade wilson from deadpool is possibly the son of an alternate version of the wade wilson from xmen origins  wolverine ,4660c5,movies,1455675804,mmmasian,2,10311,8130,0

how rooney mara was nt nominated alongside cate blanchett in the best actress category when she had six more minutes of screen time is beyond me really  academy  does jennifer lawrence need another oscar nomination  but i digress  this movie was stunning  both visually and emotionally  as  ultimately  it s a love story a doomed one  but a love story nonetheless the two protagonists  carol and therese  are so likable when they re separate  but they have palpable chemistry when they re together  which is what a lot of romance movies forget to do nowadays  the two lovers need to be sympathetic on their own if we ever expect to like them when they re together but  through scenes of carol interacting with her young daughter  and therese s interactions with her coworkers and friends  we see that these are interesting characters that an audience can get behind and more importantly  we see that they are both stuck in a situation that they do nt want to be in  a large portion of why this movie is so good has to do with its actors as i mentioned earlier  blanchett and mara are basically pitch perfect as the two lovers in this film they  along with director todd haynes  really know how to capture both the romance and the tragedy that comes along with being lesbians in that moment in history every time they share a scene together  their chemistry is damn near tangible you can tell that they felt very comfortable around one another and supporting roles from kyle chandler and sarah paulson certainly helped propel the characters  relationships forward even further  a lot of people were upset that this was nt nominated for best picture and best director and yeah  i get it now this is a near perfect romance movie  gay or straight  and everyone should see it as soon as possible ,466ddb,movies,1455680743,FredVogel,6,1,31,0
i ve realized that the timeline makes zero sense the movie is intertwined with the events of  the bourne ultimatum  which in itself was directly intertwined with   the bourne supremacy  both of those films presumably take place in 2004 matt damon recently made comments that confirm that timeline  the problem begins when we see that renner s character  died  in 03 at the age of 25 this was when he entered the outcome program  so  either renner is an incredibly poorly aged 26 year old with one year of experienceor they fucked up,466iqy,movies,1455682908,Nickbennettc,2,181,2482,0
dear god that was one of the most incredible movies i ve ever seen  going into it i knew only a few things that it takes place in world where women have become infertile and one woman has become pregnant  clive owen must guide her to safety there s a long take in a car and julianne moore gets shot yeah  it sucks that that part got spoiled for me but i was in shock it happened so early on in the movie but i had no idea that this film would be so incredible  every performance was incredible  not a single weak one the cinematography is some of the greatest i have seen and was honestly better than lubezki s in the revenant every single shot was filmed so incredibly and had me sucked in and dear god that long take when theo is navigating the city at the end was one of the best tracking shots i ve ever seen overall any small flaws i may have with this movie in subsequent watches will be overshadowed by everything else being perfect one of the best movie s i ve ever seen  1010  just one question though  what really was the fishes true motives  did they want the baby to survive or not  and what did they want to do with it  i m a little confused there ,466ix2,movies,1455682980,MojaveWalker,10,6942,3348,0

it was one of my favourite movies of that year and words can not describe how disappointed i am that so many people have no idea what it is  everyone in the movie was fantastic but daniel bruhl was fucking phenomenal i really believe he should ve been nominated that year i was on constantly on edge the  entire  duration of the movie and those racing scenes were just something else ,d011ij4,movies,1455568441,Mrs_Damon,106,55031,31805,0

the movie is great and bruhl nailed lauda s personality  in my opinion one reason i love the movie is that for the most part it did open wheel racing justice  something some trash like driven definitely did nt however  i think because it was about open wheel racing a lot of americans snubbed it unfortunately  ricky bobby and talladega nights is what american audiences will watch in terms of auto racing that  or fast amp  furious 14 ,d0120wq,movies,1455569165,ChewieWookie,10,1,14938,0

i m going to go against popular opinion here  everyone here is shitting on  hollywood  but hollywood is a massive industry with several different production companies each overseeing many  many projects that involve many  many different people some of these studios  projects  people  etc pull off amazing successes  and some of them end up as complete duds for the most part  movie ticket sales have been increasing year after year  at a rate higher than inflation  so i would say hollywood is doing a pretty good job so when it comes to deadpool  if hollywood pumps out a bunch of r rated action comedies and runs that into the ground  but they make a shitton of money doing so  they did nt learn the wrong lessons  maybe if the general public actually supported new and creative projects  hollywood would take more risks when the top grossing movies of the past decade have overwhelmingly been remakes or sequels  that says more about the audience than the producer ,d013iir,movies,1455571311,SS324,213,1,5163,1

it is a niche thing i love vintage f1 related stuff  so i really enjoyed rush daniel bruhl absolutely  nailed  playing niki luada but for those who do nt give a shit about auto racing  it was probably just a decent movie i still like grand prix  1966  better  though it is fictional instead of biographical the incar racing scenes and race footage were much better imo more intense racing footage may have broadened the appeal of rush  but it was still pretty good in any case i do nt think that the producers or ron howard were expecting this movie to be a major hit they probably expected better  or they probably would nt have gone ahead with the project  but i m glad that they did we need something for people who do nt go in for costumed superheroes ,d014nyw,movies,1455572997,epepepturbo,1,8407,15091,0

he s not wrong  the problem is that what made  deadpool  a good movie is nt always easily replicated  and hollywood is first and foremost a business that wants to replicate success oftentimes  what makes a thing successful depends heavily on the zeitgeist  think of how many movies we call  underappreciated gems  while we marvel that sony greenlit  pixels   obviously  someone  somewhere  thought that  pixels  was going to generate money and why not  it has a bigbudget star  adam sandler   a topic we all find endearing  classic video games   upandcoming stars  josh gad  and an immensely popular actor  peter dinklage   happy madison has also produced some startlingly popular  bad  movies  happy gilmore and billy madison are charming pieces of shit  to put it bluntly  but we love them because on some level they re aware of their shittiness   why  should nt  that be successful  on paper  when making a marketing pitch  that all sounds good throw a few million at it  let sandler phone in a goofball performance  and step back to count money as hookers bring you all the cocaine  right  wrong  because the hollywood financial analysis is not built to consider that merely capturing buzzwords and things that are popular fails to account for the specific historicocultural context that made them popular in the first place in less academic terms  it ignores the  heart  of why we like certain things in favor of the flash and style of the things we like ,d0198fz,movies,1455580033,ccmulligan,9,781,86163,0
definitely the sound was the aspect of this film that stood out most for me  it really used the 1 in 51 to fantastic effect all the gear shifts and engine noise were subtlety underscored by the sub rather than constant sub boosting it was actually thoughtfully added occasionally for punctuation  a think aside from the sound editing and mix the cinematography was the star of that film it had such a vibrant and evocative use of colour and light ,d019n85,movies,1455580687,teaqualizer,3,1132,17524,0
 black mass  was responsible for  my single favorite review of the year   http  letterboxdcomghostdinosaurfilmblackmass2015   gt  early on in the film a bunch of gangsters are hanging out in a car and one of them starts to tell a story about how he heard porn stars in los angeles eat a bunch of celery right before they perform he gets interrupted and never explains why they do this i was more interested in hearing the end of that story than anything that happened over the next 100 minutes of movie ,d019s7x,movies,1455580910,davoarid,78,402,9567,0

there is a pattern set by the two trilogies i think this new one will conform to it     phantom menace   and   a new hope   there s a connotation that something has begun or has yet to reach its potential  it ll brew and build up   the force awakens   definitely follows this   then you have   empire strikes back   and   attack of the clones    both titles declare an aggressive action this is when everything kicks off   of course we end with resolution in the words   return   and   revenge    notice also that the prequel s titles are the inverse of the original trilogies a new hope refers to luke the good guy  and then phantom menace to palpatine  i think    then empire clones  the clones were the good guys  and sithjedi this is probably obvious to everybody on earth but i just noticed  episode viii will probably follow the precedent set by the the second installments of the previous trilogies as i ve outlined but there are only so many synonyms for attack and strike also  the episodes were named by lucas and since he s out of the picture  they may do something different this time around  just based on episode 7 s title though  i think there s a good chance they ll repeat it  my title would be    fury of the order   of course i hope the filmmakers come up with something better ,d01roxb,movies,1455619693,rod_munch,63,29172,40763,0

the magic box  robert donat as william friesegreene discovering that his version of a camera works the film is quite romanticised  but seeing him actually run out into the street and show a policeman that his camera works is a joy and the policeman is just dumbfounded  and so was i  because i was struck on two levels  1  it illustrated to me the power of moving images from their inception  that even black and white  mute  scratchy film stock was seen as life when it was projected back then  and 2  it illustrated to me the longevity and rapid evolution of an artform that really has only existed for 120 years or so i was seeing the creation of film  set in the 1890s  made in the 1950s and shown to me in the late 2000s it was one of the few moments that made me realise the joy and wonder of cinema is the same now as it was back then  extra  the end of 12 years a slave was bloody powerful you lose all idea of how long solomon s been captured for and in one shot it just smacks you in the face ,d01un22,movies,1455629391,Story24,2,4337,304,0

fuck i have to say  the trailer does nt make the film look good the accents are ropey  the shots are uninteresting and clich   the dialogue sounds rote and formulaic  the pickpocket gimmick seems oversold and unnecessary  the setpieces all look like they ve been cobbled together from other films  the music was dull  and i feel like i ve seen 80  of the film  and i still have no idea what the actual plot is it feels like a fake trailer from a tv show or something goddamit  why can no one use idris elba right ,d01wqgv,movies,1455633836,Mr_Evil_MSc,23,4308,165130,0

yes  absolutely  fantastic film  i held off on seeing it for quite a while  because i really am not that into  car  movies this preconception was of course completely false  as the racing bit is pretty limited  and when they do show it  was very well done and exciting i had heard good things about it  but it wasnt until i found out it was ron howard that made it  that i finally decided to see it and it blew me away  such an incredibly wellcrafted film it is a character study first and foremost  between two opposite and competing personalities played to perfection by helmsworth and bruhl this was the first time i had seen bruhl in anything other than inglorious basterds  and his performance is just magnificent and this without knowing who lauda was beforehand definitely deserving of a nomination  for sure  just an incredible film  so happy i decided to see it ,d022xnd,movies,1455643372,TG-Sucks,1,1,899,0

i ve always thought that it was a bit of a disservice to past winners that someone can create something in a computer in postproduction and win the same award as the brilliant technicians who had to be skilled enough in manipulating light and shadow to get the look they desired on the film do nt get me wrong it s great that filmmakers have those tools at their disposal now  and i do nt begrudge them for using them when necessary  but it s an entirely different skill set than traditional cinematography  if there was a reasonable way to qualify films for each category  i think this would be a good idea ,d023p0t,movies,1455644417,Bice_,16,2,136,0

maybe this means bumblebee will finally get a voice box in t5 and if it s lower budget that means less boring explosions and they might service the story i do nt know a lot about bumblebee  but this could potentially draw from source material and make a good movie that might be more acceptable by long time fans i do nt claim to be a long time fan of the franchise from back when they were toys  i just like the films for my action fix and do nt expect much else also the transformers transforming is so satisfying to watch  there s a lot of wishful thinking on my part  but even though i ll go to see it anyway  i get the feeling that because it s lower budget it wo nt be overproduced and will be handled more deftly i m hopeful for the sake of others finding enjoyment from these films again  the scrotum joke from t2 has soured a lot of people i know the even numbered ones are much better  t1 and t3 are good watching  all you need to know from t2 is optimus dies  comes back and beats generic bad guy and wounds megatron dark of the moon feels like a proper sequel to t1 anyway  the story is better and the action is only where it should be the final battle is also pretty amazing ,d024ncu,movies,1455645715,Oh_I_still_here,5,1,8348,0

for some reason i once watched this horrible movie called the air i breathe  which stars forest whitaker  brendan fraser and sarah michelle gellar the film is similar to 2004 s crash in that it think it s delivering a profound message by wallowing in human misery  anyway  there s one scene where we see a flashback to gellar s childhood when she first got on the school bus and her dad tried to cheer her up by doing a silly dance and then he gets hit and killed by a car what makes it especially absurd is that this is at least the second that someone in this movie gets hit by a moving car for dramatic effect i remember when i watched this movie with my family  everyone burst out laughing  you can see it  here   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  tmyrwxhff4camp  t  6m12s ,d02jg11,movies,1455666004,Sarunowakusei,3,1,673,0

when i was a kid  the first alien film i watched was aliens and it did nt stop me from understanding and enjoying the film however  it did leave me with questions which were only answered when i saw the original  so basically  i think one can start with aliens however  i feel alien is a better movie the problem with the sequel  however  is that the first one established that the xenomorphs were practically unkillable creatures in aliens they re suddenly canon fodder  so with that in mind  aliens undermines the danger of the xenomorphs  rendering the xeno in the first film less menacing so it may ruin the first film if you watch the second first  not to mention  it ruins the first film because the second films mentions how the first films ends everyone dies except ripley even the twist is explained  where she blows up the ship but the alien happens to be in the escape pod  and ripley blows it out of the airlock total spoilers of a great movie here ,d02l4yo,movies,1455668735,MartelFirst,5,7408,133914,0

here is my take on distinctions  two categories  as shot cinematography and digital you are allowed to color correct  crop  and composting of scenes must consist of 80  imagry from the camera any other manipulation of the images will categorize as digital cinematography additionally  if digitally created elements are introduced to more than 15  of onscreen images it is in the digital category  i think this allows movies like fury road to be considered  as shot   while something like the 300 would not be  thoughts ,d02nb6d,movies,1455672057,neuromorph,4,4773,49330,0

this is honestly the best trailer i ve seen for the film and it s done as a zombie spoof  great  best thing about it is that it focused on these people as horrible people being forced into a good deed  as it should be the problem with all of the other trailers is that whenever they slow down long enough to hear dialogue it goes to hell  i m glad you cut this if they were marketing it this way i d genuinely go see it ,d02nxoq,movies,1455672994,clwestbr,2,319,100402,0

well  this article tries to say that the revenant was digitally altered after all  but it s not going in to any details the first quote is about the visual effects shots of the bear  of which there could be only two or three second  they quote the colorist like he was lighting the movie in postnot the case at all the color timing methods he mentions were being used 20 years ago when everything was still film  so with that said  where  do  you draw the line  visual effects can be an amazing tool i feel like the voting members of the cinematography category know the difference between a film carried by visual effects and one enhanced by it if it s enhanced properly  the cinematographer does deserve credit  i ve stood on film sets with lots of blue screen and minimal set pieces and you do still have to light and shoot it like you re actually in a location  in the end this wo nt be fair until more recognition is given to visual effects achievements  even though there s an oscar for it ,d02obhn,movies,1455673571,teknokracy,1,2528,22275,0

i do nt think there should be a distinction at all cinematography  to me  is nt about the means that were used to achieve it  as impressive as that can be it s about the way you utilize lighting  framing  motion  etc to enhance the story the movie is trying to tell if a cinematographer has an idea for something that will aid in that that requires vfx in post  that s great they should be judged on how effective it is  not the fact that it was done in post people may complain that it s very expensive and puts some films at an unfair advantage over others  but is it really more expensive than the alternative  take the revenant example used in the articleachieving the same effect on set would mean an even more environmentdependent  and thus unpredictable and more expensive  shooting schedule  keeping a much larger number of people on set  and thus paid  for a longer period of time  more shots  perhaps having to sacrifice the best performance for the best lightingthe list goes on and on i do nt think doing it in post was more expensive at all ,d02ogjv,movies,1455673786,dccorona,1,10,33336,0

the similar roles of tom hardy and eric bana some of the similarities are the sort of things you d find on a lot of actors cvs  they were both in black hawk down  they both played heroes of greek myth  members of the british nobility  70s intelligence operatives etc even the fact they ve both played incredibly musclebound comic book characters is nt too much of a stretch with all the superhero movies around now  but a couple of the coincidences are definitely oddly specific  for example they ve both played bald star trek villains from the romulan empire who plotted to destroy earth with super weapons  shinzon and nero  and they ve both played notorious prison hard men with distinctive facial hair in biopics named for the characters alias  bronson and chopper   one final coincidence is that bana was inspired to get into acting after watching mad max  his first car was the same model as max s pursuit special and he even made a documentary about his love for it but of course when they came to recast max  rather than the australian bana  they went with hardy ,d02p7gx,movies,1455674920,disposableday,6,4,11361,0

 drive in movie critic  joe bob briggs had a formula for how to make a successful sequel   the first rule of all drivein sequels  make the same damn movie you made the first time   and while he meant it in jest  there is a strong statement in there about making  any  movie sequel  so make a list about what was truly great about the original blade runner so many things  the great model of los angeles  worth a travelogue as a city of the future  the culture of the place with giant pyramids and smokestacks belching pollution and airships and flying cars  totally original music  not just space travel  but space war  capitalist androids and megacorporations  etc  etc  there is also the downside of filth and decay  great and small details like the dust on top of bryant s ceiling and a run down version of the idiosyncratic bradford building  the end result is a truly breathtaking and majestic movie a complete world what parts of that can both be reproduced in a sequel yet be made novel enough to grasp the imagination  for a plot  you need villains in this case  the more  the merrier nexus7s and perhaps nexus8s  running amok ,d02qkzg,movies,1455677056,WendyLRogers3,1,428,85673,0

i thought the article hit on a lot of interesting points  but did nt put enough focus on a major difference between the original novel and the two films based on it that would make any adaptation of the source material a challenge beyond the difficult subject matter that make any attempt to adapt the novel hard  an issue which the article explores with aplomb   a big part of what made lolita a superior novel is nabakov s incredible writing  and that s almost inevitably lost in a visual medium  sure  there s a lot of worthwhile thematic material to be gleaned from the plot alone  but so much of what makes the plot tolerable is that nabakov puts you inside the head of a monster  that it s an examination of what makes someone like humbert tick and the twisted filter through which he sees the world even if a movie adaptation could survive the loss of nabakov s prose  it s always going to be on the outside looking in when it comes to humbert and his deviance  and that removes the ambiguity and distance between how humbert sees himself and the actual horror of what he does  which  to my mind  is the sharpest and most incisive part of the source material ,d02qx6y,movies,1455677585,Limin8tor,1,6946,6327,0

richard ayoade s  the double  comes to mind not necessarily a mindfuck kind of movie  just interestingly directed and and the plot is creative  it s about a shy man named simon james  played by jesse eisenberg in one of his best roles  imo  who works in an office and he s in love with the girl who works a few floors up  who also happens to live in the apartment across from his a man who looks exactly like him named james simon  also played by eisenberg  comes to work at his office and people instantly like his double better  because he s confident and smooth  but no one seems to notice that they look exactly alike  a couple other interesting ones that kind of fall into the same category are stranger than fiction and ruby sparks stranger than fiction is about a man who realizes that he has been the main character in someone else s novel his entire life  and sets out to find his author ruby sparks is about a novelist who writes himself  the perfect girlfriend  and she comes to life  and he has to deal with the repercussions of it ,d02ulm5,movies,1455683818,games_and_movies,1,1,579,0

agreed wholeheartedly this movie is why  frankly  i was kind of disappointed with gravity  which was also directed by alfonso cuaron   technically gravity is breathtaking but is still this spacestation hopping modern tale of survival children of the men  on the other hand  is a fictitious world working on this fantastic premise that still works why  it s because it seems to effortlessly saturate us with little things to suggest that this world exists the religious protesters  the ringing in his ears  the family portraits around the room  to answer your question about the fishes i think it was best left ambiguous to pin it to a simple answer  i think they wanted the baby to live and for them to prey upon the blind desperation of the world on the other side of the coin cinematically  think about the little girl in waterworld she is presented as symbol to acquire control in a postapocalyptic world ,d02v8b2,movies,1455684997,Bunyip_Jack,1,11,5844,0
