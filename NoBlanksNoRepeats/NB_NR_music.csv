in light of the grammys both this year and years previous  i have a question for kendrick fans i seem to be missing the hype i consider myself a big fan of rap and have been for decades now kendrick s music does nt seem like anything special to me so when people talk and give him praise i feel like i m missing something  is it kendrick s message that is giving him attention or is it the actual music  i can understand if it s both i ve just felt that his music is subpar is it because of his support from dre  honest question because i absolutely can respect the meaning and context powerful words and verses that bring the subject matter to life just curious what others thought because i think i m alone when i say his music just is nt for me ,462eub,music,entertainment,1455629044,Simaul,86,0,1614,7128,0

after all the controversy about the oscars being too white i could nt help but think they made the grammys extra black this year not that i have a problem with it because black people tend to make better music imo i just thought it was kind of funny  like the first 3 presenters were all black  same with the host  then they brought classic artists like lionel richie and stevie wonder out and they even had a hip hop broadway show perform i just kind of wonder if they actually did this on purpose to counter the oscars to white bullshit ,464l7h,music,entertainment,1455656724,Killingtimeatwork101,5,0,2,9169,0

i have a tidal subscription ama  edit  they locked the thread so i ca nt reply but i can edit my post   no one at tidal has yet to touch me  although i think i deserve some touching for how much i m paying   the sound quality  is  really nice but i have to run it out of my pc which has my hifi sound card and to my nicer stereo any other set up and it s not worth it   i wanted to try it for a year  and i think i ve reached that point so i m probably going to cancel i thought if i gave it some time and with the amount i m paying i figured they d be responsive  they d create new playlists quite frequently  and they d get more exclusive releases they got more exclusive releases but they ve failed miserably at giving me enough new content or playlists to justify 20 a month  especially when i m paying for google music and xm as it is it s the same damn playlists   for months    they have no respect for the five customers that subscribe but you d think they d be offering us really quality and unique  exclusive playlists to justify its existence but no the people that run this should be fired because i do nt think they do  any  work   i know how to fix their company  though make this service a niche  audiophile streaming service that gives its customers customtailored playlists every week  exclusive performances and podcasts  and spoon feed us undiscovered music that s been vetted in advance that s something i think enough people would pay for they do two of those things currently  exclusive performances and some undiscovered music that s been vetted  but they do nt spend enough effort on either of them and they do neither of those well ,d00q6wy,music,entertainment,1455551821,xodsnap,1061,0,403,2133,0

on one hand  this allows him to add and remove songs from the album willy nilly  and update them  see him saying that he ll fix wolves or something  so that means he ll battle puracy by wearing them out what  every week update the tlop album  no fucking way  they ll just end up listening to the nonfinal version that released when they downloaded it the first time,d01fh6i,music,entertainment,1455589945,dizzi800,27,0,12271,56944,0

if he s as broke as he claims he is  then he s handling this like a complete moron his huge ego is getting the best of him  he thinks people are going to throw money at tidal just to hear his album get off your high horse  mr west  if you pigeonhole your customers into doing something they do nt want to  you re lumping your wouldbe customers into two groups  1 people who wanted to buy your album  but do nt want to put forth the effortmoney to sign up for a streaming service just to hear a single album  2 people who will find ways around it and get your album anyway  piracy   since only your most diehard fans are likely the ones who are going to sign up for tidal and actually  keep  the service after the trial  you re going to be left with very little    but since his label is nt that stupid  he s really just saying this as a publicity stunt   this is how it will pan out   says album will never be released  tidal reports record number of new signups   majority of those signups ultimately do nt renew  tidalhis record label realizes they re leaving a lot of money on the table by not diversifying avenues to purchase the album   kanye announces it s available on itunesgoogle playspotifywhatever  the above will pan out in the next month or so  he s already done the damage in regards to sales those who actually were anxiously waiting on the album have probably already pirated it i d be shocked if even 1015  of those who already pirated it will go back and purchase it when it becomes available ,d01i72e,music,entertainment,1455594253,OpossumSemen,30,0,67,10942,0

i was extremely hopeful that she d simply be performing lazarus  which would have been the most poignant  haunting way to say goodbye to bowie  and likely exactly what he d have wanted  the performance itself was great  gaga as expected was the perfect artist to act out the tribute she captured bowie  his stage presence  his androgyny  as best she could   his mannerisms in a hugely respectful way still  it was frantic  tried to cover too much in too short a window  and only really covered bowie s most watered down hits  especially after kendrick s performance  in opposition to the eagle s playing take it easy of all songs  a more emotional and raw performance would have been so much more meaningful ,d01ibvn,music,entertainment,1455594468,bluexy,45,0,103,5444,0

gt  pitchfork  the album is a 30 out of 10 this is not someone in a stable mental state he was super confident in this album  thinking it was easily the best work he  s ever made and most people are placing it 5th out of his 7 albums  so he  s not taking it well he  s going to release it he just needs to calm down first i think he s just hurt that the initial reaction was nt what he wanted it ll come out on other platforms  he just needs to calm down def jam would nt allow a tidal exclusive release if he s seriously  53000000 in debt  this is not the way to fix it ye would nt want an album he put so much work in to be missed out on by so many people who do nt use tidal give him time to cool off  we ll see it on itunes and spotify and google play soon ,d01it09,music,entertainment,1455595248,bryan484,7,0,216,4250,0

kanye was just fine with these publications reviewing his music when his albums were universally acclaimed and once he releases an album that is nt as favorably received  he says this shit it s totally idiotic i love kanye s music  the college dropout and my beautiful dark twisted fantasy mean a lot to me personally but i rather not have any more new kanye music if it means he gets to a better place mentally he was pretty crazy around the release of yeezus but last year it seemed like he got a lot better and was just in a better place  watching interviews from 2013 and 2015 is a night and day difference  but since around the release of this album  he s been getting worse and worse really hope he gets better ,d01lagw,music,entertainment,1455599785,drzkid64,21,0,241,5010,0

honestly  why is everyone so surprised  1 he s a part ownerinvestor in tidal he knows his work is in demand  so he s going to put it there and withhold it from the competition  2 he was still altering the album title  track list and artwork literally hours before releasing it to tidal did that not tip you off that perhaps there would be no physical copies  3 the kanye west of the 2010s does not do anything conventional it s his gimmick now he wants his  bigger than jesus  moment the problem is  he throws crazy shit at the wall continually  hoping it will stick and people get fatigued he knows what he s doing  though people are talking about his album bigger than one album is his legacy people will be referencing this release years from now  despite how it sells  or does nt sell    you ll get a rolling stone article on the album s 5 or 10 year anniversary and it will mention the unconventional album drop  how he was so ahead of his time pitchfork will give it a 10 in hindsight  best new reissue    blah blah blah it s pop culture  he s not tweeting about being in debt and asking mark zuckerberg for money for any other reason than to get people talking he married a kardashian he wore a leather skirt he called out george bush on live tv he tweets stupid shit every day  deletes it and hopes someone screenshot it for a good controversial news piece he s not even an egomaniac anymore he s just a businessman who will do just about anything he may not even have changed the album title ever it could have been a ploy form the start to get people talking   here goes kanye again   who gives a shit what he has to say outside of his music anymore  even eliciting this response from the public has him rubbing his hands together that s the whole point he s relevant ,d01ld95,music,entertainment,1455599942,imfeelingyou,4,0,1,117,0

i think everyone saying everyone is just going to torrent it now  is mistakenly forgetting that many many music consumers do nt have experience torrenting and do nt know how to do it especially the teenage demographic that make up a huge chunk of his fan base  those same people that do nt know how to torrent and do nt have the savvy to figure it out happen to know how to sign up for services with their moms debit card  yes this is a huge mistake and makes him look really stupid and will not result in tidal becoming relevant  the funniest part to me is that tidal offers a 30 day free trialso what do you think people who are forced to use it to hear one album are going to do  and they will not renew because it is actually a sub par steaming service   but the average kanye west fan does not torrent music and likely will not try to figure it out instead of just doing what kanye tells them to do  and signing up for tidal  the free trial  lol   just my 02,d01pgck,music,entertainment,1455610783,spinblackcircles,0,0,512,23458,1

i think it s the scope of his vision  the intellectual rigor of his rhymes  and the sonic ambition behind his releases tpab is an eightyminute hiphop concept album about depression and black identity in an age of black lives matters that combines spokenword poetry  hardbop and modal jazz influences  live instrumentation  and startling  introspective lyrics delivered with passion and technical precision it is daring  challenging music  dense with sonic and lyrical analogy  metaphor and allusion and it is a call for hiphop to rise to the sociopolitical and personal concerns of the present age it s attempting to innovate within its genre in the way that great ambitious  politically black albums in the past have  albums like the payback  whats goin on  there s a riot goin on  bitches brew  sign o the times  it takes a nation of millions to hold us back  yeezus  as for kendrick himself  there s something galvanizing about an unglamorous  seriousminded mc who delivers such consistent intensity and is willing to push the envelopesonically innovate in an age of  hotline bling   when people mistake future rapping  these fuckin  police ca nt touch me  these bogus police ca nt touch me  for woke  topical political content  kendrick seems really refreshing ,d01vle4,music,entertainment,1455631562,nottrapt,152,0,1,844,0

i personally am a big fan of him for his music i just love the blend of jazz  funk  soul  hip hop  and spoken word i find the messages he conveys inspiring and i believe his lyricism is far ahead of many other rappers today he s a great person as well  he seems pretty down to earth he does nt really flash jewelry around or his fancy cars ,d01w249,music,entertainment,1455632521,DaftMemory,21,0,1370,4334,0

mixture of both his message and his music for sure when i first listened to to pimp a butterfly  i did nt know what to think of it definitely was nt a fan at first  but as a jazz musician i could definitely appreciate what was going on on the backing tracks  listen to for free  holy shit that combo absolutely kills it on that track   it took a few listens before i started understanding the content  and i began to like it more and more it s definitely an acquired taste  i feel personally  i think the way his lyrics line up with the music is borderline genius specifically on alright the syncopation of the backing track under his vocals makes for a super cool texture gets me hyped every time i know my view is definitely different from others  but it s more or less directly related to my background prior to hearing it  edit  if you want a grasp of his content look up the lyrics to  u  and  the blacker the berry   super powerful i could nt listen to  u  all the way through the first time i heard it it hit too close to home ,d01wkl5,music,entertainment,1455633529,majorjazzhole,70,0,386,293,0

i m with you  op admittedly  i am not a huge raphip hop fan but i do like shit tons of songs from the genre it s just not my usual go to genre my biggest issue with him is i literally ca nt understand a word he is basically saying he raps so fast it just sounds like mumbling to me the stuff i could make out was great though if it s all about the message then i would like to hear the message without googling his lyrics and having to read it somewhere what s the point then  now  with all that said  i thought both his performances at the grammys the last couple years were awesome  the imagine dragons duo last year was pretty epic  the incorporating of the sax and the background music in his performance last night was super tight too i guess i really want to like him but the 100wpm rapping just turns me off to it maybe the studio versions are better ,d020aqj,music,entertainment,1455639629,kermitsio,6,0,20,3336,0
yeah i would nt say that kendrick is a musical or hiphop innovator in any specific way  though he draws upon and blends older genres  boombap  soul  funk  jazz  in interesting ways  with the help of a whole host of collaborators   what makes him special is what he has to say  that he has become  in some ways against his will  a central voice of this generation he continues the hiphop tradition by meditating on his origins  and realizes that the struggles he has experienced are part of a larger national culturalpolitical struggle and he articulates this well  at times beautifully he is conscious without pushing an agendarather he inviting an audience to view his thoughts i also think that tpab was nt meant to be for everyone  that it was supposed to make people uncomfortable but i think the music  especially the critical  community was too afraid to admit this discomfort and  as a result  the album was instantly and universally lauded as a classic not that i do nt think it is  i do it s incredibly rich both is its music  its lyrical content  and its sociopolitical implications but i think its possible that the world s initial reaction to it has misrepresented it  and kendrick lamar himself or maybe the world was ready for it i ca nt say for sure ,d020bey,music,entertainment,1455639656,schwaza,4,0,1,1357,0

solid question  and i think it goes without saying that this is subjective but i believe  kendrick is capturing a higher level of musicproduction  lyricism  both in meaning and in artistry of the lyrics via literary devices   flow  and appeal in  to pimp a butterfly  he demonstrates his deeprooted culture using facets like jazz  ramp  b  soul  funk  and of course  hiphop and rap i sincerely believe this album will go down as one of the best albums of all time  and i hope so not just in rap  but in all music the fact that he followed up an alreadyincredible album of  good kid  maad city  with an album that is only preceded in its number of nominations by michael jackson s  thriller  should speak for itself  but there s more to it the man s a genius and is backed by producers and other musicians who help that shine ,d0213do,music,entertainment,1455640774,WARHARSE,5,0,2,56,0

him making it impossible to get anywhere else  obviously lost him sales  but i m not 100  convinced that 500k number is shocking  or out of the norm for any major release that is available at all outlets  including physicalretail   fact is  most people no longer value music at what it used to be valued it people do not see an album being worth  14 what s interesting about this is  other entertainment mediums  have not had this problem on such an overall level  like music does people still value a blu rayticket to the movie  although that is quickly changing with netflix and digital streaming   people still value a video game and while i get all those other things are pirated  music seems to be a thing where like everyone no longer sees the value in it  at the cost it was priced at   a big part of that happening is convenience the music industry resisted mp3streaming so it was much easier to just torrent it was literally easier to access something via pirating i believe even with streamingand itunes today  it s still sometimes quicker higher quality to torrent music but i think because of music s file size  meaning it was always easy to dl music   the industries refusal to adapt  meant an almost worldwide drop off of people seeing  value  in an individual album at the  1420 price  and honestly  i think even when albums are available at all digital outlets  i still think a lot of people out there  do not value an album at  14 or even  10 i think  45 is more of a sweet spot but the music industry has refused to move on their pricing and before someone gets upset and says  think of the artists well yeah  then maybe labels should nt be so greedy and take such a large  chunk out of things even at  45  if they took a more even split  the artist would get paid more  it would just mean the labels not making as much profit  but anyways  my point is  i m not 100  convinced that this is as shocking as people think it is yes  i do think kanye is being stupid as fuck for making it tidal only and it def lost him sales but i m willing to bet that even if the life of pablo was available everywhere  you would see just as high piracy rates  the value is just no longer there to people and i think that is especially true  now that people are paying  1014 a month for streaming  and having access to millions of albums  if the ability to pirate stopped today  most people would not go back to  buying  albums physically again and to those that do  most people would go back to buying only 810 albums a year  because they have to then budget what they can actually afford to listen to people no longer value the cost of an album  and most people do nt even have the money  to buy all the kind of music that is out there  i think indie acts would get hit the hardest  and would lose their platform for exposure  this way too  and to those that point to taylor swift  and other acts that sell millions of physicaldigital they are really like the 1  that pull this off they are driven by a rabid fan base  and also propped up by a system  that gives the mass exposure they are not the norm and while they def do sell a lot  i bet you anything  their pirated  s are prob higher than this    tldr    kanye is an idiot for making this tidal exclusive but i still think that if he had released this everywhere  you would still see really high pirating  s people no longer value the album at the  1420 price even if available digital ,d024cs7,music,entertainment,1455645315,Blooodborne,44,0,1,692,1

he is one of the most technically gifted rappers in the game  flow  rhymes  using clever metaphors and wordplay  versatility  inflection   and he s consistently used his talents to tell vivid  honest  important stories with a lot of depth and these stories happen to be very relevant to what america is talking about right now in race so right off the bat  you re getting an incredibly skilled and talented rapper  the music  using his voice to tell stories and make points that need to be heard  the message   now factor in that gkmc had top notch modern production  and tpab has an almost unprecedented mix of jazz  funk  rock  and straight up hip hop  and he s also pushing musical boundaries the jazz musicians he worked with on tpab compared him to the legendary john coltrane  saying that he had incredible vision and focus and was pushing everyone in the room to be their absolute best and work together in new musical directions  and that he s so gifted a rapper that he manages to keep his voice and flows and the meaning of the song at the forefront so he does nt just have great music and a great message  he s pushing music  and  the conversation into new territory ,d024qnv,music,entertainment,1455645838,whatswhat61,1,0,4784,58403,1

interesting that you say this i do nt care about lyrics very much at all  but i still became absorbed in tpab lyrically more on point though  i genuinely think tpab is an incredible album musically  and the best rap album i ve ever heard i ve never heard anything so creative in hip hop before i do not like good kid maad city nearly as much  because it s mostly just standard rapping with clean and standard beats  even if it s done very well that and the whole conceit of making songs that are generic and sound generic but are somehow better because they have nongeneric lyrics  swimming pools  i do nt care about your lyrics enough to let you get away with calling a bad song good  kendrick luckily tpab does not compromise creatively in terms of music or lyrics  and that makes it the full package for me ,d025kk1,music,entertainment,1455646971,Evilknightz,1,0,2099,14754,0

i was like you i did nt like kendrick i thought his flow and delivery were weird i thought his voices were strange his style is extremely different from 80 s 90 s and 00 s rappers  last year i listened to tbap  and became a fan his weird rap style grew on me  and i started to  get  him things about him that stand out  1  his lyrical content he raps about many different topics  growing up in compton  struggles of the blackminority community  his distrust towards authority  whether that be the music industry  the police  the government  corporations   racial issues  his own struggles dealing with fame and fortune while trying to  keep it real   his other demons and personal issues  etc etc etc his songs usually have some double meaning theyre very dense and layered  2  his storytelling ability his songs are basically stories he is very descriptive and engaging good kid maad city is an album telling a story  yet each song can stand on its own tbap is similar  3  his flow at first it sounded weird to me  and offbeat but he has a catchy rapid fire delivery it s amazing to listen to he can rap slow too listen to alright  4  the music he uses good productioninstrumentals for his tracks tbap was full of jazz and funk gkmc was more hip hop  but still had unique beats ,d0275sf,music,entertainment,1455649108,xamountofaction,1,0,135,4541,0

1 i think it s going to go down in history as one of the best albums ever  partly because of this whole buying it situation it encapsulates nearly every sound ye has had  has songs for everyone and their different tastes  and does everything so well it seems ye is getting more selfreflective  lonely  and he s reaching out to people with this album he made what we want to hear  he incorporated so many different samples and features  and it all fits together seamlessly the focus on god is interesting  and i think it s his way of excusing all he s done  while simultaneously accepting who he is as a crazy genius trying to help the world but not necessarily doing it perfectly  2 i think tidal is okay  but atm tmobile does nt give me  free  data to use it so jury is still out on whether i ll keep it  3 lol and can i just say i m still having a blast listening through the whole thing  and i honestly could nt tell you how many times i ve already heard it ,d0292rd,music,entertainment,1455651694,AvaNater,-7,0,1,50,0

i guess i use tidal i mean  i used the service before kanye bought it back then it was still called wimp and i really liked it then i have nt  upgraded  to the tidal format yet  because i really enjoy the wimp format wimp was a music streaming service meant for scandinavia so for me  who is from scandinavia  i get a really good experience i get local articles  playlists  reviews and more and wimp was a really good platform to discover obscure scandinavian music that was a big deal for me since i m a huge fan of norwegian black metal but if i  upgrade  to tidal  i fear these perks will go away no more articles  or reviews tailored for my culture no more obscure norwegian bands who released exclusively on wimp as a sort of patriotic gesture the only thing that keeps me form switching to spotify now are my playlists and favorites if i could export all that over to spotify  i would do it in a heartbeat  and btw tidalwimp lags out if you try to play a playlist larger than 5k songs mine is at 8k now and the service freezes for a good minute every time i press play and i have to press play from the  favorites  tab  because if i try to enter such a large playlist  none of the songs will load ,d0294v7,music,entertainment,1455651771,Landsfaderen,6,0,0,0,

i personally love the life of pablo and it gets better with each listen  my only gripe is the overall structure of the album  which seems confused  and the awful mastering mike dean did  but all of ye s album have poor mastering so i ve come to expect it   it s strange to me that kanye completely changed the tracklist order weeks before release  as well as all the album title changes  and the thing is  he had been working on the actual material for a long time i actually think too long in some cases  as i feel he made too many changes in certain areas wolves and 30 hours are worse than their original versions he overcooked some things in those instances   but the overall album structure makes me think he did nt have like a clear vision of what he wanted this album to be  rather he had a set of ideas and great music he was making and that works for me  i do nt get why the day before it was released  he threw tracks 1418 on there though they do nt really fit with the rest of the album i love those songs individually  but it feels like an ep tacked on at the end  if it was me  i would drop tracks 1418 all together and make it a 1113 track album  closer to the msg version   with the album ending with wolves  the original version   i would keep fade and replace feedback with it and i would also swap out freestyle 4 for no more parties in la not sure about the track order  but those changes  keeping it 13 tracks long with it ending with wolves the original cut  would make the album imo much better despite the albums flaws  i like the production more than yeezus and am finding myself liking it more and more with each listen i just wish he had been more thoughtful of the albums overall structure and track listing  and that he would stop mastering his albums so poorly  this time there was no excuse  as he allowed mike dean to do it whereas in the past it was sent off to the label for vlado meller to butcher the mastering   great overall album do nt really get the criticisms that it s too abstract or pieced together even songs that have random production transitions  still have fully fleshed out song structures leading into the transitions  and the actual production in the transitions are amazing love the ending of famous and pt 2 for instance   i just think the overall tracklist problems make songs seem less focused then they actually are try swapping out the two songs i suggested  and i think it flows better  or maybe not it is subjective opinions after all some might love feedback and freestyle 4 i do nt hate them  just think they are weaker than the rest and kind of hold up the flow of the record   as far as tidal goes  dumb move by kanye unacceptable tidal took money and did nt send dl codes no idea if ye really will release a more finished album  if it will be big changes or minor tweaks   but the whole release is a clustefuck i do nt find it genius  since it s been at the expense of customers and their money now but great album overall imo    tldr    great collection of songs  but tlop has a confused tracklist structure and terrible mastering the actual content is great though and gets better with each listen  i would personally rank this over yeezus and graduation  although i think graduation has some of his best productionsampling and is a great pop album   mbdtf  lr and 808s are still my personal favorites ,d02bcw7,music,entertainment,1455654718,Blooodborne,9,0,1,692,1
i love how polarizing topic of kanye is and how this subreddit loves to attack anyone that seems to like his music to some degree  anyways i m of the opinion that this album is a big mess  but an organized and intended chaos if you listen to the tracks in the order of the original tracklisting you ll notice an increase in cohesion and organization in music with respect to the production  and theme  emotion   i m convinced he messed up the ordering intentionally to increase the element of chaos which seems to be the theme for this album  from the production to  promotion  to release  to the chaos that is his current life having said all that  this was nt his best kanye but it definitely was a refreshing one that fused his production style across his discography in one  and it s one of his more fun one after a lot of listenings and thoughts  i m enjoying it for what it is  i m pretty ticked off on the poor mastering and audio quality of some tracks however it can be argued that this was done intentionally along the theme of chaos but as a semi audiophile it s rather annoying when you hear cracks and pops on audio equipment i spent almost  1000 on ,d02bjnx,music,entertainment,1455654959,MyNameIsDan_,10,0,2668,22794,0

at first i was nt going to read 300 songs then i got to the comments and had to go back to read what you put then i was nt going to comment  thinking that you would nt read it  or respond i ca nt stop thinking about the list  so here is my input  i think it s a great list i can see some of your personal preferences have made it in there and that s going to happen  like ruiner instead of head like a hole or hurt by nin   also  i can see where some people will want you to take out x artist of a genre to put in y artist of the same genre that will be a hard decision on your part  welp  here is my two cents on what to put in  black crows jealous or she talks to angels garth brooks thunder rolls or friends in low places ludacris what s your fantasy  since he is 10  maybe rollout  nelly ride wit me sinead oconner nothing compares  i know she did nt write it but dang it s a great version and the most popular  jeff buckley lover  you should have come over etta james at last nina simone feeling good soggy bottom boys i am a man of constant sorrow pantera cowboys from hell  or since he is only 10 years old this love  r kelly i believe i can fly seal kiss from a rose or crazy steve miller band anything by them stone temple pilots creep or plush or big empty or interstate love song styx come sail away the verve let love be your energy 311 all mixed up some songs to consider taking out  walking the cow yo la tengo  can replace with neutral milk hotel  mia yaz my chemical romance  kind of a small genre that was filled with better bands like thursday  thrice  the used  finch  kid rock garbage  easily replaced by the cranberries  also  some bands can be taken down a notch a beatles song can be taken out to make way for a single artist and you ll still have 4 beatles songs  anyway  great list and kudos on your for taking the time to do this everyone s list would be completely different the great thing is you get the last vote ,d02ccoe,music,entertainment,1455656015,kittenpuppystarwars,5,0,213,308,0

i m happy for a swedish band  but at the same time personally feel as though lamb of god deserved it more  their newest album really pushed their sound into a new and surprisingly good direction  plus after all randy blythe has been through over the past several years  i think its somewhat of a miracle that they were even able to put together a new album  never mind one that s so interesting and fresh sounding for them  it might also just be me  but i am already tired of ghost s schtick they have going on with all their imagery they re trying to convey i ve already seen it thanks to king diamond  these guys just seem like posers to me  and i am over it shower me with downvotes now  but i m just stating my opinion ,d02copz,music,entertainment,1455656466,The_UnApologist,1,0,647,9751,0

late registration  the life of pablo  yeezus  the college dropout  mbdtf graduation  808s  this is how it stacks up for me  but my perspective may seem different because yeezus is pretty much the album that converted me to a rap fan so i was nt onto kanye when his earlier discs were released ,d02dd4o,music,entertainment,1455657380,IncipientMonorail,4,0,46,1559,0

i like the album it feels kind of like a sloppy my beautiful dark twisted fantasy  injected with plenty of yeezus  while trying to do something new it s a little uneven and i do nt really like the tracks between pt 2 and i love kanye  but the beginning and end are really solid  i m a little worried about kanye i love the dude and all his jackassery  but he seems to be going nuts but it s kanye so god only knows what s going on  the tidal thing is annoying i like to buy albums  so i was prepared to do that once tlop dropped  so i m kind of peeved that there s no solid answer if i ll ever be allowed to do this and i d rather not stay on tidal after my free month ends the sound quality is nice  but i m already pretty used to spotify and my itunes library  and dropping spotify for tidal just for tlop sounds a little stupid i m hoping the shitshow resolves itself fairly soon ,d02dqd3,music,entertainment,1455657869,XD00175,5,0,1,4356,0

i was always a huge fan of kanye s work his albums have consecutively been my favorites for years  and i was so happy to hear tlop was on its way  i was fine with it coming out on tidal first for streaming and was happy to even pay  20 for it  but then he switched gears and made is a tidal streaming only and basically gave a huge middle finger to all of his fans  and that was it for me  i have always separated the man from the music  but when this just took things to such another level that i could no longer do it anymore  not subscribing to tidal  not pirating his music  just giving up on him completely took the previous albums off my phone and not even listing to that anymore ,d02e2a6,music,entertainment,1455658312,ruready4thepenis,2,0,233,7238,0

i was nt going to read the list  but i had to after reading all the comments so here are my two cents i tried being as objective as possible  though some of these artists are definitely some of my favorite  the beatles probably do nt need to have 6 songs in the list  i d stick with at least 5  but maybe 4  though i do nt know which ones i d remove  for black sabbath  i d probably replace iron man with paranoid alice cooper  school s out instead of i m eighteen creedence clearwater revival  bad moon rising  proud mary  or fortunate son instead of susie q the doors  light my fire instead of break on through eric clapton  cocaine instead of it s in the way that you use it fleetwood mac  something from the eighties instead of one the songs  since they re both from rumours genesis  great choice  they re pretty much my favorite band  but maybe either choose something a little more prog rock  or something more eighties  since those are their big genres  led zeppelin  communication breakdown can be substituted by another bandartist maybe a lionel richie song  either hello  or all night long michael jackson  thriller instead of beat it neil young  include old man or down by the river instead of one of the others outkast  ms jackson instead of hey ya patti smith  because the night instead of free money prince  purple rain instead of little red corvette since you have donna summer  chic would be a cool choice to also include  and maybe earth  wind amp  fire  i d also include something from supertramp s breakfast in america and one from jamiroquai  like virtual insanity  and one boyband and girlband  like backstreet boys and spice girls  also sorry for the long comment ,d02hvmk,music,entertainment,1455663606,ruteds,3,0,1,12,0
i m sorry but this list has too much of your bias  and by that i mean too much rock revival songs 3 led zeppelin numbers  they did nt top the charts in their own time 4 nirvana songs  i mean i like both the bands but to do list 3 and 4 of them and only two of michael jackson and elvis is just a crime  tbh you could scrap most of the third and fourth songs of one band if you re going like that  this list has too much 20something rocker afficienado stink on it ,d02i10d,music,entertainment,1455663831,Gooiwegding,1,0,1,1323,0

kanye fucking nailed the marketing of this album the hype never died and keeping it in mystery really helped too bad he fucked up the release by making it a tidal exclusive  overall i really enjoy the album as think it s pretty great but a lack of cohesion  pretentiousness  and the occasional dumb lyric or two really hold the album back from being the masterpiece that it could have easily been and clearly wanted to be  810,d02i4c1,music,entertainment,1455663972,Infamaniac23,4,0,439,10452,0

i want to hate kanye because he has gotten so out of touch with being an actual musician for the most part  what with tidal and it s rich kids club of  elite  musicians who get to make more money from their streams simply because they re famous  and his comments on his twitter about how only black people can comment on his music because that s who it s made for  but then i actually listen to the music and it does nt matter because it s great part of me just wishes that he would remember that he s a better musician than jay z and that sometimes that s enough and he should stop trying to win over beyonce with his lack of business acumen  but whatever because ultralight beam is amazing and i m choosing to ignore that kanye is presenting himself as a total basket case  although i think he s trolling us all  ,d02ig14,music,entertainment,1455664460,RampagingKoala,2,0,22,34919,1

there are several genres that are underrepresented but are still huge parts of popular culture  whether they re your cup of tea or not   examples  edm  metal  dubstep  modern movie soundtracks  musicals  90s boy bands  etc if you truly want a representation of modern music  tracks from such genres are absolutely necessary  how would you make room for them  you have several artists for which you have multiple songs this should really only be done if both songs are very different and both had huge cultural significance for instance   one  by u2 is nt really necessary it s not their best song  even by their own reckoning  and it does nt give you a huge amount of additional value after listening to something kind of similar in  where the streets have no name   three songs from the smashing pumpkins is also quite a lot imho however  having  we will rock you  and  bohemian rhapsody   both by queen  is probably a good idea they re very different songs that are both outstandingly significant in their own right  some other random suggestions   maybe replace  me myself  and i  by de la soul with  clint eastwood  by gorillaz  which featured de la soul   that way you get a taste of both bands   do you really need both songs by neil young amp  crazy horse   i think  lose yourself  should be there over  my name is  for eminem  personally  as others have noted  there also needs to be more female representation in this list  great job though  fun read  great post ,d02jd8v,music,entertainment,1455665887,sarcastic_potato,2,0,0,0,

i m sure i ll get downvoted for this  but as a longtime metal fan since i was like 12  i am really struggling to see how cirice  or even ghost in general  is  metal   this sounds like heavyriff downtuned melodic  rock   what  cause they re playing palmmuted c  tuned guitars they re  metal   where s the doublebass  where s the technical riffs  where s anything north of 80bpm  light  airilyharmonized vocals and  piano breaks  and this is  metal   power chords in 134 downbeats does not metal make  to be fair  thus far all i ve heard of ghost is meliora but that was 30 minutes at my friend s house when he tried introducing them to me where i was barely tolerating it and certainly will not buy it  or anything from it how this beat  lamb of god s 512   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  dulxbkkj9wg  or slipknot in the  metal category   and while neither of which are even in my top 20 favorites bands either  eg  1 is testament   2 is trivium   3 megadeth  but are both at least certainly more  metal   is beyond me i m not asking for meshuggah or arch enemy out of a swedish melodic metal band for a metal category win  but at least maybe  unsun   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  2o2aec2o4w  or something with a little more energy  cirice about put me to sleep  but  oh wait  this is  the grammys  we re talking about  judging metal right  carry on good for them i guess ,d02jw8t,music,entertainment,1455666792,Silidistani,0,0,285,25491,0

obviously any list is going to be subjective but i think it would ve been helpful if there was at least some kind of methodology to how you picked these songs that is if you want this list to be a representative cross section of music across multiple eras if you just want a list of the  greatest  songs then you can have him a copy of that issue of rolling stone and just fill in the last couple of years yourself  i would start by increasing the size of the list 300 sounds like a lot but it s really not and your kid has time to listen i ve heard just about every song on your list some of them maybe hundreds of times  then i would limit the number of songs from each year maybe to ten or so yes some years have been better for music than others but there are certainly ten great songs from every year dating back to the beginning of the last century  though i would nt go that far back   if your worried this would exclude a lot of songs  well  thats inevitable  once you narrow it down by year it is a lot easier to create a diverse list because you are nt comparing songs from 2015 to songs from 1965 and obviously that criteria will evolve as you move through the years early on you ll want to include motown  then ditch that for disco  add in some hip hop later on and then edm even later on ,d02kaad,music,entertainment,1455667406,U2_is_gay,1,0,1255,65801,0

i m personally not a huge fan of hiphop i mostly listen to metal  stuff like opeth  meshuggah  born of osiris  etc that said  i can appreciate talent and passion in other genres as well  which has led me to develop a taste for tech n9ne  tupac  and dre  i decided to give to pimp a butterfly a listen on the suggestion of a friend  and i ve been completely blown away it s my favorite album right now  i ca nt stop listening to it i m a big fan of jazz  so i love all the jazz elements he s using i think as a technical rapper  he s not quite at tech n9ne or eminem s level  but he s close what sets him apart  in my mind  is his lyrics they re pure poetry there are so many hidden meanings you have to figure out he does nt always spell out what he s saying  you have to piece it together  the entire album comes together into this powerful narrative about the institutionalizing of blacks in america a lot of what he talks about are well known topics  like the cia attempts to undermine the black community by distributing crack cocaine and setting gangs on each other it reminded me of tupac s lyric   give em guns  watch em kill each other  it s a fact that the prison population in the us is overwhelmingly black even if we assume that it s that way because blacks commit more crime  and not just because the judicial system is harder on them   then you have to understand that it s not because of their race  it s because the lower socioeconomic levels in this country are predominantly occupied by blacks when people are dirt poor  they sometimes become more desperate to pull themselves out of poverty  and are willing to commit crimes to do so and when there is an institutionalized pressure keeping a specific group in the lower class from rising  that group might go to even more drastic means to break through  you then have to ask yourself   why would the institution  target blacks like this   the answer is another major theme kendrick touches on in the album there are still a lot of really racist people out there who genuinely hate black people and view them as subhuman you would think opinions like these would be gone in our enlightened age  but they still flourish people are just less open about it  generally i ve dated a couple black girls in the past  and i honestly could nt believe some of the things that happen to them being stopped by police for no apparent reason people refusing them service  or customers at their place of work requesting a white person help them i would nt have believed it if i had nt seen it for myself multiple times and this is what the black community faces each and every day  so  what are they to do to overcome this systematic opposition  the answer is another major theme of the album  the black community needs to stop fighting amongst themselves and unify to improve their lot being a big tupac fan  this message really resonated with me  as this was a major theme of tupac s lyrics the album  i feel  leaves you with a feeling of hope  that this is something that is within reach  just to specify  i am a white male born into a middle class family  but kendrick s message really opened my eyes to what black america experiences every day and i think that was his real goal  not only does he want to sound a rally cry for the black community to unite  but he wants to open the eyes of the white community  and make them see that there is still a problem with systematic and institutionalized racism in america that needs to be addressed so  i love this album for the great music  production  and rapping  but i think it will go down as an alltime great because of the powerful message in contains hopefully that was helpful to you ,d02lbev,music,entertainment,1455669003,Wraithpk,3,0,471,17050,0

i m really enjoying tlop i love how it jumps schizophrenically between somber introspective kanye and abrasive in your face kanye i love how it goes from the grandiose gospel intro that brought tears to my eyes to a line about a bleached asshole so much of it is chaos but i love how every part of it sounds even the interludes  i like them being there as a bit of breather i love how lyrically clunky kanye can be  sure it d be nice if he was better but his clunky lyrics  sound  good with the music  even if they do nt read the best  i for sure can see how it would turn people away  even longtime fans but i really appreciate kanye he can be such a prick  he loves stepping over the line and getting reactions  but i like that there s someone like that out there the guy is an artist who does nt compromise for better and worse whether he s releasing a bold album that actually works or just being self destructive  he s all in  so i m cool with this whole tidal fiasco it was a clusterfuck of an album release  if you can count it as an actual release with the tweet about  fixing  wolves it s interesting to watch go down though how people who got tickets to the yeezus season 3 thing still do nt have their copies  how much it s been pirated already  how allegedly it s not going to be anywhere else by next week we ll see what the real fallout of all this is  but you ca nt deny that it s entertaining to watch fall apart if you do nt take it personally especially since kanye has nt backpedaled yet  he s only doubled down  i ve moved almost primarily to streaming services for my music  so it ll be a bit of a drag if it really does stay tidal exclusive since i primarily use spotify but i m still in my postalbum release binge so it s not annoying yet when my tidal trial ends if it s not on spotify i ll probably not buy it immediately though it s a great album but there are so many other fantastic albums i have nt heard yet that i do nt have to pay extra for or deal with having the files locally  like how long it took hbo to let people without tvs pay them to watch any of their shows if you re not going to make it simple for me i will end up on the path of least resistance with their shows it was easier to pirate for my watch  but i have this free trial of tidal that i m going to use for now when that s done i d like to be able to keep listening to tlop  but i d be cool with having this month long fling with it that i can look back upon fondly  and yeezus hurt me with the shitposting weekend on rkanye during that failed release just kidding that was one of my favorite things i ve seen on the internet it s been a fun 5 days with tlop  even though we ve only had it for 3 of them ,d02lkob,music,entertainment,1455669384,CNUanMan,0,0,684,8917,0

alright i ve ciphered through some of the comments on here on people justifying how this is a good album  and i have nt come across one valid point of why this is a good album his best three album were his first three banger albums  and quite frankly that was kanye at his prime  when he added flair to the rap game  but still keeping it grounded where is lyricism was on par with most other artists at the time  and where his beats sounded like true rap beats if you do nt believe me  i recommend you to listen to a track from lop and a track from late registration  and you will almost immediately notice the difference in quality  performance  depth and lyrical flowcontext  kanye either chooses to rap or be meta  and quite frankly his meta phase is coming off as insane vs conceptual i do nt see any depth in his music anymore  i see no reference without hypocrisies  and parallel to both yoko and trump in that sense  kanye has officially left the rap game   ,d02m73x,music,entertainment,1455670327,kpatsart,6,0,96,132,0
the smiths  there is a light that never goes out  or anything off the queen is dead album  the smiths had a big influence on britpop  oasis  blur etc  which was huge in the 90s in the uk  oasis should be on there as they were huge in the 90s plus a link to modern music as adele has only just beaten their biggest selling first week sales and they came out on a thursday friday  sold something like 600k i think it was in 23 days  she had the whole week ,d02mcm2,music,entertainment,1455670565,IWasHereButNowImNot,1,0,617,622,0

if you had read the comment from the guy who started it you would know it was a joke  here   https  wwwchangeorgpunitednationsphilcollinsmustbestoppedu14100714  there is some  not so much hate but disapointment  among fans of peter gabriel s genesis due to what the band became with phil  personally i think even that was better than his solo career  but i do nt hate him  i just do nt listen  and of course there s this classic evaluation from american psycho  gt  patrick bateman  do you like phil collins  i ve been a big genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album  duke before that  i really did nt understand any of their work too artsy  too intellectual it was on duke where phil collins  presence became more apparent i think invisible touch was the group s undisputed masterpiece it s an epic meditation on intangibility at the same time  it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums christy  take off your robe listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of banks  collins and rutherford you can practically hear every nuance of every instrument sabrina  remove your dress in terms of lyrical craftsmanship  the sheer songwriting  this album hits a new peak of professionalism sabrina  why do nt you  uh  dance a little take the lyrics to land of confusion in this song  phil collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority in too deep is the most moving pop song of the 1980s  about monogamy and commitment the song is extremely uplifting their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything i ve heard in rock christy  get down on your knees so sabrina can see your asshole phil collins  solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying  in a narrower way especially songs like in the air tonight and against all odds sabrina  do nt just stare at it  eat it but i also think phil collins works best within the confines of the group  than as a solo artist  and i stress the word artist this is sussudio  a great  great song  a personal favorite ,d02mqcc,music,entertainment,1455671171,Atalantean,0,0,2780,11472,0

just something on my mind  i see a lot of parallels between azealia banks and kanye west both are rap artists revered as great producersmusicmakers that routinely receive critical acclaim  but loathed for having horrible personalities  what confuses me  though  is that  out of the two  azealia banks is the one that gets the less respect people seem to overlook her as just another famewhore and toss her aside comes time for rap discussions  i mean  despite the fact that her debut album broke with expensive taste was lauded by critics and rap fans alike  ended up on in the top 10 of all the  best albums of 2014  lists and was released within the deadline for the 2015 grammy s  it was snubbed  then there s kanye  with an equally horrible  if not worse  personality  that gets hailed as a music god by many for some reason  it seems like his music can be treated as a completely separate entity  which ca nt be the case for azealia banks whenever he s working or in hiatus  people can generally agree about the fact that he sucks as a human being  then as soon as he announces or releases something  he s back in everyone s good graces  i m a fan of both artists  music  but i ca nt understand how azealia would be treated any differently than kanye west both are music geniuses with despicable personalities  but i actually feel like azealia is the lesser of two evils pretty much all she s done is be abrasive on twitter  give opinions on subjects she clearly does nt understand and involve herself in arguments that do nt really concern her  which is nt that bad of a resume considering she s young and stupid kanye  on the other  is an almost 40yearold man that is quite possible sociopathic  definitely has a narcissistic personality disorder  seems to be a pathological liar  and thinks he has word of god  edit  on tlop i ca nt figure if people that claim it s a great album are being sarcastic or are just ye fanboys  this is not a great album  especially considering how overhyped it has been for multiple years the album has been in production onandoff for five years  so i think i was expecting something different instead  we get a ridiculous amount of featuring artists that pretty much all carry their own songs this just seems like a rehash of everyone else s styles it s not horrible  but it s far from kanye s best 6510 at best  for me ,d02przw,music,entertainment,1455675804,catlantica,2,0,34,243,0

in my opinion  these bands need more songs   rem  the fathers of  alternative  and a huge band in popular music  i would suggest either  everybody hurts    shiny happy people    radio free europe   or  it s the end of the world as we know it  to add alongside  losing my religion    queen  a lot of people have mentioned the lack of queen already i would suggest adding under pressure  a 1 for queen and bowie  killing two birds with one stone   red hot chili peppers  highly influential and perhaps the biggest name in funk rock  while remaining popular over decades maybe  otherside    californiacation  or  ca nt stop   these could do with less   the beatles  nothing against the beatles  but with the limited space in a 300song playlist  6 songs seems a bit much   nirvana  i love nirvana  and they were a huge act in the 90 s  but i d say 4 songs to represent 3 studio albums  worth of time is a bit excessive   pink floyd  i d cut brain damage as much as i love that song  the others are better representations of the popular side of pink floyd maybe addreplace one with another brick in the wall pt 2  the velvet underground  highly influential  yes  but they were a commercial failure while they were around i do nt think they need two songs on a popular music list   the smashing pumpkins  1979 is my favorite out of those  but also the one i think i d cut  different songs on these   radiohead  from a popular music perspective  i think  karma police  is would be a fitting replacement for any of the three  not sure if you were trying to focus on 80 s and older  but here were some new songsbands i thought were missed   iris  goo goo dolls  push  unwell  or how far we ve come  matchbox 20  the scientist  coldplay  uprising or madness  muse  she will be loved or this love  maroon 5  someone like you or rolling in the deep  adele  with arms wide open  creed  all star  smash mouth  u ca nt touch this  mc hammer  semicharmed life  third eye blind anyways  those are just my opinions  and what you have here is very good already tried not to let my personal tastes get in the way too much  ,d02qazb,music,entertainment,1455676628,baconbash,1,0,527,11673,0

i m still not sure how i feel about the album i ve listened to every other one of his albums over the last two months and do nt think it really measures up as a full album or track to track a lot of it is really good but there is nt a great flow through the album with a lot of questionable choices  starting with ultralightbeam i m not into it  chance has a great verse but the track is so repetitive and slow to start that i did nt even notice how good the verse was till taking it out of context of the song  part 1 is a great piece of music around some really bad kanye verses  pt 2 ye is a little better but its mostly just listening to panda by designer with a few twists  famous again has a terrible start to his verse that just tanks an otherwise pretty great song think with this and part 1 he is trying to do way too much contrast  it worked in hold my liquor but not here  feedback is nt any good  amazed it made it on the album have nt got anything from it that makes it stand out from other crap  low lights is nt really a song either  no ye at least  highlights starts to sound like graduation and very celebratory but again i notice the complaint that kanye is not a good lyricist at all and for the first time in 7 albums i m agreeing for the first time  freestyle 4 again is nt really good  nothing kanye on it  sounds really generic 2015 rap song  i love kanye is a self aware meme  i m not sure how it fits  waves for the 3rd time is a great song that ye does nothing good with in his verses  fml and real friends are fantastic  the best of kanye comes through here it sounds like the flows and well thought lyrics of college dropout through mdbtf  wolves i would say is the same  but the older version is probably better  30 hours starts strong and is a good song but it drags on at the end like an outdo  but three songs are left  no more parties in la is a pretty great song because for one kendrick is on it and kanye has more good lines in one verse here than the first 10 songs of the album  facts is a decent song but again seems at odd with kanye being at the front leading but is generic  a bit boring and disappointing even if not bad  fade is really nice beat and definitely is something i can jam to  kind of shit that sounds a bit odd the first time but is a great sound  i have nt seen anything too bad about tidal except lots of stuff out in spotify being hidden in menus wo nt be using it at all after if gets a full release though ,d02rgst,music,entertainment,1455678461,bruvar,3,0,4,7285,0

lots of thoughts here and my thoughts do nt tend to organize themselves well wo nt be offended if you dick around and read random parts  though of course i ll never know  i really really like some of the picks here and i really like what this list is trying to do  but i feel like even with 300 slots to fill  most artists should be limited to 2 songs at most i m also incapable of not thinking about the rock and roll hall of fame 500 songs that shaped rock n roll list even though there s a lot they could do better  it comes across as a sort of oligarchy for certain artists when they have 7 songs or something  even if it s the beatlesstones it s subjective  but i just feel like screaming the precious slots oh we re losing them we only have fucking 500 or er 300 i guess this 2orless rule has to exclude the extremely heavy hitters like the beatlesstones example  i think two songs is just right for the sex pistols given their disproportionate impact on  popular music  and the amount of music they produced i do nt think you can justify  say  smashing pumpkins having 3 while the velvets have 2 when the velvets are the most influential american band ever though same goes for other 90s altrock giants nirvana and radiohead  if i had the list i would do smells like teen spiritscentless apprentice  basically one from nevermind one from in utero  though smells like is kind of obligatory because it s inescapable  and one from ok computerone from kid a  subjective again  kick creep cuz fuckit    it s been doing a very good job of covering a lot of genres with some leftfieldish indie bands and some leftfieldish picks that are nt the artists most famous songs i like that i think parts of this should be subjective  a playlist feels really inauthentic and too easy to make while being less actually representative when it s just  by default  the absolute most famous song an artist has made or that came out of a movement however  some songs are pretty inescapable subjective here  and i know we already have the blurandoasis  but pulp s common people is pretty inescapable and is floating somewhere around my top 10  pop  songs ever uh  and i really think  for example  sonic youth s teen age riot is an infinitely better pick than kool thing  even though i love chuck d and quite like that song  considering that kool thing was sort of a majorlabel copout diss song to ll cool j and teen age riot is fucking teen age riot  cmon  that riff   and ultimately more popular i would call it inescapable  also  while the playlist might get down and dirty with the original original roots of a genre  eg punk  it has all 4 of the great protopunk bands  including some great picks  though it s  of course  subjective  the velvets  i m waiting for the man was important because it was garagey and punky and heroin was incredible in how it relates the experience  and a lot of the very derivative bands  eg punkwithaprefix  poppunk   i think it s missing a lot of the important bands in the middle eg  can we really justify my chemical romance  even though i honestly think the band s decent  and 30 seconds to mars and blink182  i think blink deserves a spot  and so does green day  and fall out boy when there s a good chance none of them would have been nearly the same without the descendents   melodic hardcore  and pissy awesome catchy hooky speedpunk and also  for examples from the 80s scene of indieturnedmajor bands  husker du and the replacements  example  iirc billie joe took a lot of songwriting influence from westerberghartmould   there has to be a line drawn or a limit set for how derivative of a genre bands can get even if i like a lot of them quite a bit also  example  3 u2 and 1 rem when rem was basically the most popular band to help turn indiepostpunkyfolk rockjangle into alternative rock when going major  while u2 is nt bad but in the grand scheme of things is less important  also  wikipedia is probably your sort of friend here a very difficult  concerted effort needs to be made to include an insane amount of movementsgenres if we re being fair to popular music as a whole even if the playlist comes out as completely inane  hint  it already has and that s a good thing   also  individual suggestions off the top of my head  if i got too deep this would kill my next few hours even if i would enjoy it quite a bit   the message by grandmaster flash and the furious fivemelle melduke bootee  i would also say public enemy is more deserving of more than one song than many others on the list  and they took the social commentary of the message and really ran with it    this 10year old s going to fucking die of something when he hears all this shit but really  you covered a lot nice maybe the wisdom of the crowd can perfect it ,d02rs0m,music,entertainment,1455678973,IAmTheLoLrusMan,1,0,0,0,

i m an older dude and a huge genesis fan so i ll give it a shot this is why i do nt like phil collins  phil was the drummer in one of the seventies greatest prog rock bands around respect for that peter gabriel left and phil replaced him on lead vocals after a massive search for a new lead singer that turned up nobody that interested the band  the great music continued with phil on lead vocals in the late seventiesearly eighties really brilliant stuff gabriel was not missed a few albums into the phil led genesis they had a hit song  follow you  follow me   this was the beginning of the end  but not quite yet  then duke great album  but much more commercial that s cool still a great album and the band is growing  abacab fucking hell  this album is fucking amazing the greatest album genesis has ever released imo commercial  a bit  yes does nt matter brilliant stuff  here s where things start going wrong self titled genesis is next mama dark  beautiful and haunting a huge hit home by the sea the hit that was nt for some reason illegal alien pop garbage and utter shit but mtv blew it up the brilliance that was genesis was about to become a pop band money  girls  fame  whatever it was enticing for the band  they would not release another  good  song after genesis side one with home by the sea the rest was commercial bullshit this is exactly where i personally gave up on them as a band and stopped listening and buying their albums  phil goes solo the allure of fame is too much for him it s all radio friendly pap feel it in the air is undoubtedly a great song  but it was supposed to be a genesis song  and should have been phil collins blows up as a radio friendly pop superstar his musical integrity is fucking gone it s one shitty pop song after another absolutely nothing of substance  then he s doing disney soundtracks let me say that again he s doing disney fucking soundtracks  the drummer  later lead singer of one of the greatest progressive british bands of all time has sold his soul and musical integrity to disney for a paycheck  that s actually the last thing i ve heard  or cared  that phil collins has done he s musically irredeemable in my eyes he is the epitome of a sell out i have lost a lot of respect for him over the years ,d02tvkl,music,entertainment,1455682527,thewhitedeath,2,0,42042,169593,1
so one of the big things i noticed in the 500k illegal downloads thread  before it was locked  was people saying this probably is no different than the numbers any other artist gets that appears to be 100  wrong  https  seatsmartcomblogbillboardvsillegaldownloads in october of 15  the top on the list was drake who had 250k illegal downloads for his last album half of what kanye has in just a couple of days taylor swift does nt appear to break 25k kanye has seriously sold his album short and is most certainly going to lose a lot of money on this deal  now the big if  this is assuming these numbers are accurate it looks like the sources are as follows  the 500k number came from torrentfreak  who posted screens of tpb seatsmart pulled their numbers from kat says the article regardless it does appear even comparing just one site to the other  kanye has far more downloads than any other artist  especially in such a small time period but i m not sure how 100  accurate the numbers are  just an fyi post ,d02tzbk,music,entertainment,1455682714,SavesTheDy,2,0,4019,825,0

wwwthejobfactorycomaupressrelease  there is a table showing the iq of each group of fans on the website not sure how to copy it across  employers could skip expensive psychological tests when interviewing prospective employees and simply ask them who their favourite singer or group is  an iq survey for australian and new zealand job finding agency the job factory found that kanye west fans had a lower iq than fans of every other singer or group in the study  adele fans had the highest iqs  the survey of 498 former clients of the job factory involved asking the same 25 iq questions to all participants at the end of the survey  the job seekers were asked to nominate their favourite singer or group from of a list of 10  the survey found that the average iq of kanye west fans was 84  at the very low side of normal on the iq scale the average iq in australia and the usa is 98 in the uk it is 100  director of the job factory craig binnie said  kanye is often considered to be a bit of a goose and it s not surprising that his fans have got a few kangaroos loose in the top paddock employers need stable and rational employees  so they might be wiser to skip the kanye west groupies and look for someone who prefers adele  ed sheeran or sia taylor swift fans are also brighter   adele is always polite and intelligent and seems to attract the same type of people as fans  the survey found that while west does have many fans with high iqs  on average  his fans are among the least intelligent ,d02vy4z,music,entertainment,1455686399,TheJobsFactory,1,0,2,1,0
